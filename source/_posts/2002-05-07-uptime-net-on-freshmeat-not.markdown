title: Uptime .NET on freshmeat... not
---

I submitted <a href="/devel.jsp">my Uptime project</a> to <a href="http://freshmeat.net">freshmeat</a>. Since it still doesn't run on linux, they won't list it yet. So, guess what I'll do today... fortunately, it will be very easy to do the modifications needed. 
 The difficult part will be to have mono running on linux. I have the 0.10 release working, but I'd like to have a more recent snapshot. I'll probably download one snapshot from the <a href="http://mono.baselabs.org/">baselabs</a>, though I've seen in <a href="http://debianplanet.org/">debianplanet</a>'s headlines (I've been unable to access the site since a couple of days) that there already are debian packages for Mono.
If I can get them running, I think I will be able to submit it again this night.
