Well, I can't deny it was a long time without posting. Been having exams and this kind of stuff, and needed time to concentrate and time to relax.
Seeing that I have now something mildly interesting to post about, I'll start again.

I arrived here last night with a couple of cow-orkers, to attend some training on our own products. The people here keep saying this is an uninteresting town, however, the town is so different from Barcelona (specially the architecture) that I'm enjoying it anyway.

I'm missing Mireia though. Hopefully next time she'll be able to visit the surroundings.

We'll 'nuff said for the moment. Don't want to abuse the post now ;)
