title: PathFinder 4 is out
---

PathFinder 4, the latest version of the Finder replacement from [CocoaTech](http://cocoatech.com/), [has been released](http://www.cocoatech.com/news/archives/2006/01/14/index.php). Unfortunately, my iMac is still on [the repair shop](http://www.microgestio.es/), so I won't be able to test it. I tested PF3 and didn't like it enough to buy it, I found it was slow. But apparently PF4 will have features that exploit the new Tiger services, so I will try it again soon.
