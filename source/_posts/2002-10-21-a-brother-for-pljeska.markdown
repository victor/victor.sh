title: A brother for Pljeska
---

We are going to bring a brother for Pljeska.

That is, one of the brothers of Pljeska (they were two males and two females) is going to be adopted by us too. A friend of us, who adopted him in the first place, no longer is allowed to have him in his shared flat, and he has asked us to adopt him, or at least have him for a while until he can have him again.

We thought that Pljeska wouldn't be so lonely while we are out working if she had her brother with her. Actually, he's her twin, for both of them are <i><a href="http://www.cfainc.org/breeds/profiles/russian.html">Russian</a> <a href="http://www.russianblue.org/">Blue</a></i>-like, as opposed to the rest of their brothers.

His name is OÅ¾ujsko, by the way. Yes, like the <a href="http://www.ozujsko.com/">croatian beer</a> :)
