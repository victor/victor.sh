title: Amazon Association

I just created an Amazon Associate ID to see if it can help me support this site. One of the most visited pages on this site, the number one Google result for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=gaudi+new+york">"gaudi new york"</a>, already has an Amazon UK link, and I recently referred two sales. Since it also refers a lot of visitors who end up not buying anything I deducted they probably are US visitors who decide to buy at Amazon.com instead.

So, to put things easy for them (and for me) and help me test my theory I have included the link to Amazon.com. If my theory is correct, I should see an increase in successful referrals.
