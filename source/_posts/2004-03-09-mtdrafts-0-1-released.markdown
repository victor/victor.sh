title: MTDrafts 0.1 released
---

My new plugin for MovableType, <a href="http://slunj.carotena.net/projects/mtplugins/mtdrafts.php">MTDrafts</a>, is just out of the oven.

Use it to extract and iterate over all your draft entries. Why would you need a list of draft entries? I use it as a teaser, to create interest in articles I'm about to publish. See the plugin page for info on usage and download.
