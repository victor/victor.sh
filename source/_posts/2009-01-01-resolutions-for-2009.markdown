title: Resolutions for 2009
---

I don't usually write a list of resolutions, mostly because I don't use to formalize this kind of list as such. But I though this year I could give it a try, at least one that can be bloggable. Without further a do, let's go for it:

* Write more on this blog. Currently I'm posting more to my Spanish blog, [Principia Programmatica](http://principia.info)
* Put an XML-RPC plugin into mephisto to be able to blog on the move from my iPhone. I also want to use my own themes.
* Learn a new programming language. I'm almost decided for Smalltalk, but it could also be Processing or Nu
* Practice Objective-C and Cocoa. Perhaps on the iPhone, even.
* Also, I want to learn RubyCocoa or MacRuby. Whichever. As for Python, I don't think I would be able to fit Python 3.0 in the schedule, I don't currently have a use for it.
* Finish reading at least 70% of all the books I currently have started but haven't finished yet.
* Write a Facebook application.
* Get a media center for the living room. I'm saving for an AppleTV, but withouth HDMI on the TV set it's a bit silly yet. I haven't found a reasonably priced adapter kit yet. Perhaps the Mac Mini slated for Macworld expo next week will do, who knows?
* Contribute to some open source project. I have already sent patches here and there, but since I'm using Mephisto intensively, I'll scratch my own itch and write a couple of plugins at least.
* Master git, and perhaps buy a subscription to github. I don't really need a paid account yet, though
* Modernize my home network. I have some scattered old PCs that aren't currently being used, and their old hard disks are beginning to catch bit rot. I'd like to get a new home server, to store all my pictures/movies/mail, and perhaps to develop some of my projects on it.
* I want to use all of my skills at work, at least the most enjoyable ones. If that means switching jobs (in this dire economic situation) so be it. I'm tired of reading people like Paul Graham or Jason Calacanis, but being afraid of leaving my comfortable and safe work place.

Ok. That's about it, I think. Let's review this list in a year or so...
