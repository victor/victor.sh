title: "For the record: Weblog Timeline in SVG"
---

Everytime someone in blogdom comes up with something new (FOAF, RSS link tag, blogchalking...) I wonder why I hadn't thought of it before, for most times they are great, simple ideas. Sometimes (like in CSS styling RSS feeds) I think to myself: well, I had already thought of this, there was just some reason it didn't work for me and could'nt spend enough time experimenting with it to make it work.

OK, I have enough of this. I've been maturing an idea in the back of my mind, and have begun implementing it. But, because of this <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/000731.htm">lazy web</a> capriciousness, someone other could complete it before I get to it, so I'll just let this entry here as proof I had already thought of it:

I am writing something (probably an MT template, and if it can't be done, an MT plugin) to render a timeline of posts to a blog, in SVG. I'll use CPAN's SVG module and probably <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/past/mtperlscript.php">MTPerlScript</a> to do it.

Of course, I need all my readers to blog this idea so as to certify I had already thought of it first ;)

<b>Update:</b> I trackedback to <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/">BH</a>'s <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/lazyweb/">LazyWeb</a> site, to allow for other people helping me out. I've already done a bit of progress, I'll try to post a screenshot once I get to it. I'd need now ideas as to how to layout the timeline, please post below how would you have the timeline to look like.

<b>Update:</b> See the screenshot I was talking about:
