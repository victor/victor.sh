From the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/58988.html">International Herald Tribune</a> (emphasis mine):

<blockquote>Melander said he expects the wireless ISP business to be fragmented, with services provided by ISPs, mobile operators, infrastructure operators, city networks, enterprises, property owners and <b>even underground organizations offering free access in apartment buildings and neighborhoods.</b></blockquote>

That's it. Europe wireless networks (or at least, <a href="http://www.barcelonawireless.net/">Barcelona's</a>) will be community networks.

I'll be attending the meetings organized by BarcelonaWireless. I want to be one of the builders of tomorrow's networks.
