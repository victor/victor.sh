title: Using Firebird
---

It's seems it is fashionable now to ditch Internet Explorer in favor of Mozilla Firebird. I had used Phoenix (as it was formerly known) but felt it was clunky, slow  and ugly. While it displayed webpages as well as Mozilla, the user experience was not that good, and the UI lacked some polish.

I decided a few days ago to give it a whirl again, and it has surprised me very favorably. Its faster now, the default theme is very nice and has some features that make me give some consideration to the idea of suplanting IE as the default browser: for example, the Style Switcher, an icon that appears in the status bar and allows you to choose between different alternate stylesheets that maybe available for the page you might be viewing. Or the plugins (also known as extensions, to differentiate them from normal browsing plugins) which allow to add functionality (that might already be present in Mozilla, though) such as the link bar (if I get it to work) or the headers view.

As I was saying, probably in a few days (if I get used to some of its quirks or, it could be said, de-IEntoxicate myself) I will use it as my default browser. This will mean I will make some changes to adapt my own website to it (I mean, to fully leverage it. I've never made a browser-specific site and will not do it now). For example, ditch my own style switcher (which currently, in the non-blog areas of the site is actually used to switch languages!) and use the mainstream syntax, and even add a couple more styles (been enjoying <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/">SimpleBits</a> as of late ;)
