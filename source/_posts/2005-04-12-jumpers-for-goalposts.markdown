The last 2 people (Amadeu and Diego) that remained on the Barcelona office came to Southampton the night of the Sunday and yesterday the whole company was in Southampton. Some of us played a football match (Spain vs. UK) at the Mayflower Park near the office after work.

After that, the Spanish office people -except for 2 of them who shall remain unnamed and went to play <a href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">Wow</a> in a local cybercafe- went to have dinner at Chiquitos, a mexican restaurant. Unfortunately, the service was sooooo slow, that we ended up getting out of there in time for going to bed again.
