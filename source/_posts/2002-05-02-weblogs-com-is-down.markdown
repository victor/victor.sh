title: Weblogs.com is down
---

It seems that weblogs.com caught the ramen worm. I had intended to see if the new entries in Syntactic Saccharose appeared on their listings, but I found that their server no longer responded to my requests. The curious thing is that just before that I had been browsing casually their site with no problems. At first I thought it was some problem with the network, but as Dave Winer explained in <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/04/30#lcdb25d57b0eabf587d5c47030e8a1651">Scripting News</a>, it was a server outage, not a network one. <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?display=uptime&site=www.weblogs.com">According to Netcraft</a>, they had recently migrated to linux. I wonder if this incident makes them consider migrating again. They could move to MacOS X (which is recently supported on some of their products) or to a .NET enabled platform, which would allow them to do cool things too, but is a chore to maintain (not the .NET framework per se, but the W2K/IIS side of it)

I think it's ok that I have to wait for my 5 minutes of front page stardom. That will allow me to improve the new site, which is gradually (and painfully slow) being put up.(At this point, I'm waiting for my provider to tell me where I have to upload the jar files for the sites. Even though the <code>web.xml</code> file is correctly processed --or so it seems-- the jar files in the <code>lib</code> dir are not examined).
