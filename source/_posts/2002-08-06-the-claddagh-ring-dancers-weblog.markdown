title: The Claddagh Ring Dancers' Weblog
---

While my provider is still setting up proper JSP support on its servers, I have created the new <a href="http://www.claddaghring.org/">Claddagh Ring weblog</a> for updating people about our gigs (and jigs ;)

For the moment in Spanish only. Should the need arise we would create another one in English.

This weblog uses the 2.21 release of MovableType, with TrackBack and other features. Let's see how good it works...
