title: A secret project
---

I've begun a secret project recently. I can't talk about it yet &#2014;if ever&#2014; but I'll let you know that I've been in the play-offs, the semi-final and am at last at the final.

It's been thrilling to play, but of course, what we all are after is victory, isn't it?

<b>Update:</b> I didn't won this time. Better luck the next occasion, I suppose, but how much til I get to participate again?
