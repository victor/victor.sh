title: Nesting in bloglines
---

I had assumed that <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">bloglines</a> would allow for nesting in its feeds, but now that I've really needed it, I've found that it is not so - or else, that I am unable to figure out how to do it.
I've even tried to submit an OPML file with the nesting already set, but alas! no such luck.

Anyone knows of any other online reader? I will be trying RSSOwl meanwhile...

Oh, I forgot, I am not accepting comments yet. Please write with your comment, you should be able to deduct my email address.
