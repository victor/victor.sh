title: Office move

Today we moved offices. Pivetal Sistemas is now one block away from where we were yesterday. The new offices are more spacious and posher -or at least, half of them are posher.
We've just been connected and already we have internet access, thanks to Frank and Brad, our local networking experts.
I will post pics later, once they are downloaded from the cam.
