title: Let's go to Zagreb
---

In late August, I will be going to Zagreb. I've just been signed up to attend the <a href="http://www.physanth.org/eaa.html">13th Congress of the European Anthropological Association</a>.

I will be attending only as an <i>accompanying person</i>, since I know next to nothing about anthropology. However, my gf will be participating, and I get to go with her. Since I'm still technically speaking an student, I get the discount, which is a good thing ;) I won't be just hand resting, though. I will act as an interpret and as a web-chronicler. I will carry my trusty laptop to relay an account of everything blog-worthy.

The plan is to rent a van and hit the road, together with her colleagues at the faculty. It'll be a nice trip, they say Croatia is beautiful, and her friends are a nice bunch.

Fortunately, the Congress' official language is English. My croatian is very rusty these days! :)
