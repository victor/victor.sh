title: Hello umm... World?
---

I have installed this <a  href="http://www.cooperatingsystems.com/helloworld/feature-overview/index.html">Hello World</a> thingy and, while I can attest that it looks very polished, I don't know what to think of it. I just don't know what to do with it.

If any of the readers of my weblog wants to try and connect with me, just use the slunj.carotena.net address. I want to see what's supposed to happen.
