Another line of figures that I might start to collect is <a href="http://www.rackham.fr/">Rackham</a>'s <a href="http://www.confrontation.fr">Confrontation</a>. I don't know about its gameplay, but the miniatures are ultra detailed and its design is both attractive and funny. Kinda reminds me of the drawings of Pasqual Ferry, Azpiri or Dani LÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½pez.
It seems (I'm still investingating this) Rackham has spinned off a wargame of it's skirmish game, the so-called <a href="http://www.rag-narok.com/">Rag-narok</a>. I shall be re-learning french again...

Anyway, the figs are so cool that it might be worth collecting them by themselves. You might look some alternative painting schemes for them at the <a href="http://www.conf-federacion.org/taller.htm">Canarias Red Dragon Conf. site</a>
