title: ASP.NET::Gallery

After some quick test, I have checked that in the .NET Framework <code>Image</code> class, <acronym title="Exchangeable Image File Format">EXIF</acronym> info is stored in the <code>PropertyItems</code> collection.

This allows me to port <a href="http://apachegallery.dk/">Apache::Gallery</a> to ASP.NET.

Coming soon to a server near you...
