The <a href="http://deinococcus.allbio.org/"><i>deinococcus radiodurans</i></a> is the living organism that resists the highest radiation levels without being harmed. Russian researchers <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99992844">now believe</a> this living organism to be of martian descent, for it would be impossible to develop this resistance with the current natural radiation levels on Earth.
