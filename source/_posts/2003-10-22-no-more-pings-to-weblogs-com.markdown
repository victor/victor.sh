title: No more pings to weblogs.com
---

I've stopped notifying weblogs.com of this site updates. It was just eating my bandwith, skewing my logs and not reporting any extra visits.

So it's off now. From this entry on, weblogs.com is no longer pinged. I don't know if it will mean radio users will stop noticing updates, that's something that I will learn in due time.

Probably blo.gs is next, if it keeps timing out or failing to notice the updated content each time I ping it.
