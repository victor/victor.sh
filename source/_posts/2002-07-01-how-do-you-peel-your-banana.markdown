title: How do you peel your banana?
---

<blockquote>The same experiments turned up a remarkable pro-Petal instance of the Law of Unexpected Consequences regarding those long stringy things on the sides of the banana that you peel off after you remove the skin. According to our two experiments, peeling from the non-stem end greatly increases the chance that those strings will stick to the skin and come away with it, obviating the need to remove them separately. (...) Further field work might uncover even more bizarre behaviors, but that's a job for anthropologists, not economists. Our time is much too valuable.

I prefer green bananas. I don't like moderately ripe bananas, they are too soft and squishy for my tastes. If it doesn't crunch when you bite it, it's not green enough.
