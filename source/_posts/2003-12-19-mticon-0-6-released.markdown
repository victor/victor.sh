title: MTIcon 0.6 Released
---

I've just released version 0.6 of MTIcon. MTIcon is a MovableType Plugin which allows you to include a nifty icon next to each commenting user on your site, provided they have correctly set the icon at their own sites.

While it's already version 0.6, it's only the second version released to the public so far. It still lacks some features, but I think it is useable enough to be submitted to <a href="http://mt-plugins.org/">mt-plugins.org</a>.

Upcoming versions will feature more advanced caching, and wishfully relative URL resolution.
See the details at <a href="http://slunj.carotena.net/projects/mtplugins/mticon.php">the plugin page</a>.
