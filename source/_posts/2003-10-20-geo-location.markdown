I've been assigned to a project to develop a service for serving online maps to mobile users with a WAP-enabled device.
The tricky part is not creating the map (as we've had for some time a service for creating maps centered on arbitrary coords.) but getting the location info out of the provider. It seems the service is only half-way implemented, and poorly documented, so we've got to use IM (Messenger, in particular) to talk directly to the provider.
This means I had to install the latest and greatest of the Messenger clients. My eyes hurt!
