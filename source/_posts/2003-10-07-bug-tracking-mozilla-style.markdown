I've installed <a href="http://bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> to help me track down bugs in my own projects. It will help me prioritize and remember which bugs are there to hunt down.

If you spot a problem with this site, or are a user of any of my projects, feel free to <a href="/bugzilla">browse</a> or <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi">contribute</a> to the bug list.
