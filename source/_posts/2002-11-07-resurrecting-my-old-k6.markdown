title: Resurrecting my old K6
---

When I came to live with Mireia, I brought all my old computers from my parent's house. Although I have plans to set up a network, I haven't bothered yet because we haven't got DSL installed yet (and we ordered it back in June!) so I just connected computers with a cross ethernet cable when the need arised.

Yesterday I got a few hours to spare, so I revived my old K6-200, plugged in a network card that came with the first DSL kit and reviewed it just in case it still contained some information I might want. I had forgotten most of the passwords on the machine, but fortunately I could recall the important ones.

Since I didn't have any install CD handy nor the time to look for it, I left it at that for the day. My intention is to plug in more memory &mdash;currently it only has 64 MB. I thought the motherboard only accepted EDO RAM but it seems it also accepts DIMMS&mdash; and make it the home server, the one to be constantly on, dealing with the firewalling, fileserving and calendaring duties.
At first my intention was to use debian for the task, but today I have been pondering the idea of using FreeBSD (or even GNU-Darwin) as well. Any opinions?

<b>Update:</b> Dammit!! <a href="http://www.opensource.apple.com/projects/darwin/6.0/install.x86.txt">Darwin does not work on AMD systems</a>... and my desktop P-III has a VIA chipset :(
