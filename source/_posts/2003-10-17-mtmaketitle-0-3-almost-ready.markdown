title: MTMakeTitle 0.3 almost ready
---

The awaited new version of my plugin for MT, 0.3, is almost ready. As soon as I can squash a bug related to AntiAlias selection, I will release it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/">Brad Choate</a> for his helpful comments and additions.

<b>Update:</b> For the moment, it's broken also when used from multiple templates: font names and sizes don't get stored and thus different pages use the same images (as can be seen in this entry)
