well if you ask me, and since I recently got into Mac OS X hosting and am curious about it, I'd do a (searchable) statistic on which platforms (for hosting that is) are favored by bloggers. I am really curious about other webloggers hosting on OS X.

Incidentally, this entry is also for testing trackback :) I suppose you don't mind, Ask :)

<b>Update 5 Sep 2003:</b> I have deleted the trackback to mt.develooper.com because it wanted to use https and this breaks MT in <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-ports/2003-May/001028.html">some way</a>. This, in turn, prevented a whole-site rebuild, thus causing links to some entries to break.
