title: MTMakeTitle 0.3 ready
---

It seems MTMakeTitle 0.3 is ready, the 2 most blatant bugs have been squashed (always take into account precedence when using the <code class="inline">unless</code> construct!!)
I'll try to package and release it tomorrow, as <acronym title="Release Candidate 1">RC1</acronym> to have it tested a bit more.
