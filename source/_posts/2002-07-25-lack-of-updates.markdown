I admit it, I have been a terrible blogger those last days. The little time I had after work has been spent either away from a computer or a net connection, or working hard on other side projects of mine.

To let you know some random things I've done over the last couple of weeks, I should speak about the <a href="http://www.barcelonawireless.net/">Barcelona Wireless</a> project, some work on <a href="http://www.europerator.org/apartments/">Paddy's</a> and <a href="http://www.thalassa-online.com/">Pedro's</a> sites, and the ocasional book reading: I received the two wireless books from O'Reilly via Amazon, and bought a couple more (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590590252/victorweb-20">Advanced .Net remoting</a> by <a href="http://www.dotnetremoting.cc/">Ingo</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596003099/victorweb-20">programming C#</a>  from O'Reilly) at the Tech-Ed bookshop.
