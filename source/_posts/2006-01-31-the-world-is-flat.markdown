title: The world is flat
---

It's been a while since I last spoke here of a book. Probably because of the overhead of doing so (you know, linking to amazon and that) and because I had been reading mostly technical books, or books in Spanish (which are OK for linking to occasionally, but not the whole <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=victorweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=books%26keyword=alatriste">Alatriste</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=victorweb-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> saga)

<div style="text-align: center;"><a  href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0374292884&tag=victorweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325"><img border="0"  style="margin: auto;" src="http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0374292884.01._AA_SCMZZZZZZZ_.jpg"></a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=victorweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0374292884" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /></div>

In any case, the latest book to fall in my hands, and that I have been avidly reading, is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0374292884&tag=victorweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325">The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-first Century</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=victorweb-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0374292884" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />. It's an interesting account of the history of globalization, and how it is affecting the services economy. I had wanted to read it since an interview with [Friedman](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/opinion/editorialsandoped/oped/columnists/thomaslfriedman/) appeared in the back cover of [La Vanguardia](http://www.lavanguardia.es) 

I have barely started reading it, but I'm already hooked. I find the tone in which Friedman speaks about the Bangalore workers is a bit demeaning, though.
