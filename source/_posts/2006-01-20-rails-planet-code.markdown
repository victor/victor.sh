title: Rails Planet Code
---

I have been playing lately with the code that powers the [Planet Typo](http://www.planettypo.com/) site, [RailsPlanet](http://rubyforge.org/projects/railsplanet/). Looks like it has been left a bit, because there were a few bugs easily solved left behind.

Since I am using this code in <acronym title="Yet Another Project of Mine">YAPOM</acronym>, I will fixe some of its bugs and submit a couple of enhancements as well. Among those, how not, favicons support (to help discern where those posts are coming from)

I shall enhance the layout, as well. Planet Typo is a good example of how well rounded out you can have a planet.

Also, I will add support so that bloggers that use Typo can send a ping to the Planet site to have the site's RSS scanned immediately.
