title: Escaping Movable Type
---

So, due to a recent defacing attack on another MT site I admin, and the constant barrage of spammy comments and trackbacks (that lead to having both disabled on this site, in order to avoid being DOSed) I've decided I will move my blog out of my home server and into my TXD account, while migrating to a rails based solution.
Since blogging seems to be the canonical app everyone does with rails, there's lots of options. I will have to do a round up and review each of them. Things I will score will be ease of migration off MT, trackback-comment functionality (including spam-evasion techniques), multi-user multi-blog capabilities, XML-RPC support and ease of template customizability.

I will install them on the TXD account to test them (after all, what good is being capable of using them in my box if I can't deploy them on the production-server-to-be?). So stay around and you will be able to see the test posts
