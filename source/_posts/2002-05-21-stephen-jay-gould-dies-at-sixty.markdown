title: Stephen Jay Gould dies at sixty
---

Read today on Slashdot that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/TECH/science/05/20/obit.gould.ap/index.html">SJG died yesterday</a>. I'll admit that I haven't read Gould's works (yet), but he was on my to-read list. As is <a href="http://www.carlsagan.com/">Carl Sagan</a>, another greatly missed science writer.
