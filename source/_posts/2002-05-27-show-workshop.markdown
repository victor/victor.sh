I have failed to mention before, that this Friday at 20:30h, the <a href="http://www.claddaghring.org/">Claddagh Ring Dancers</a> will be dancing at <a href="http://www.casaelizalde.com/">la Casa Elizalde</a>, a civic centre located in a house in the heart of the Eixample district in Barcelona.
The Barnyard Boys, as usual, will bring the music, while we do the dancing.

Also, this Sunday we'll held a workshop to help beginners learn the basic steps and get up to speed. For more information, write to <c>claddagh at carotena.net</c>.
