title: Cow-Orkers blogging

Long time no blogging!

It seems the time is ripe for starting a blog. One of my cow-orkers is blogging his experiences in Southampton, he has just started <a href="http://tachasuk.blogspot.com/">Experiencies a UK</a> (Experiences in UK) where he narrates how is he enduring/enjoying his work while working on site in the mother-company's offices. Be warned, the blog is in catalan only -- though he may write something for the benefit of english readers, who knows.
Another cow-orker, who shall remain anonymous for the time being, has expressed his interest in blogging engines. Provided he starts the blog, a link will be supplied to it.
