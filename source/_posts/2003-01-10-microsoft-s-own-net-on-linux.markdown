title: Microsoft's own .NET on linux
---

Phil Wainewright muses about <a href="http://www.looselycoupled.com/blog/2003_01_05_lc.htm#90162625">Microsoft giving more importance to the .NET platform than to Windows itself</a>, and the ongoing decoupling of the two products. He ends up with this not-so-surprising prediction:

<blockquote>How long before some version of Linux earns the "Microsoft .NET Connected" badge? That day may be closer than anyone expects %u2014 I predict it will be in the first half of 2004.</blockquote>
