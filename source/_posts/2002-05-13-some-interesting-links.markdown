Some interesting or curious blogs I found:

<a href="http://www.whilliamshatner.com/billspace/index.asp">William Shatner's Billspace</a>. That's right, the sci-fi writer (what do you mean, he played Kirk on TV?) has his own weblog too!!
U2 also's got <a hre="http://http://u2log.com/">a blog</a>, though it is fan made. Which isn't a bad thing, actually.
<a href="http://www.deftone.com/blogzilla/">Blogzilla</a>. A weblog <a href="about:mozilla">about mozilla</a> ;)
There's even <a href="http://www.sexxxxpics.com/blog/">pr0n blogs</a>.
<a href="http://http://live.curry.com/">Adam Curry</a>'s Weblog has attracted a lot of interest lately, due to his <a href="http://live.curry.com/stories/2002/05/08/theBigLie.html">&laquo;The Big Lie&raquo essay</a>.
<a href="http://www.topgold.com/blog/">Underway in Ireland</a>. A laptop powered travel journal of a developer roaming the Emerald Isle. My inspiration for the travel journal I want to keep of <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/000008.html#000008">our trip to Zagreb</a>.
