title: RSS tips at XML.com

Interesting article by <a href="http://www.diveintomark.org/">Mark Pilgrim</a> at <a href="http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2002/12/18/dive-into-xml.html?page=2">XML.com: What is RSS?</a>.

Now that I'm writing a <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/000155.html#000155">tool</a> that will consume RSS, I welcome this insight on how to deal with the myriad versions of RSS out there. For the moment I'm using <a href="http://perl-rss.sourceforge.net/">XML::RSS</a>, which means I'm restricted to RSS 1.0 feeds (I don't feel like supporting 2.0 for the moment, and the meat of the tool is displaying the time info on items, so 0.9x is not up to par, for the moment...)

Of interest also the <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/12/19.html#dive_into_xml">commentary</a> of the author on the process behind his appearance on XML.com
