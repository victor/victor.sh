title: Janis Ian and the Internet Debacle
---

Insightful articles by <a href="http://www.janisian.com/">Janis Ian</a> attacking the credibility of the RIAA and NARAS when they claim they do what they do to protect the artists interests. Amazing to realize how little they pay artists and how they held them hostages of enslaving contracts. They can't even release out-of-print albums!
