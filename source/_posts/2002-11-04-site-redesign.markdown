You may wonder why I haven't been posting new entries for a while. In addition to the usual busy schedule (I'm having exams) I am redesigning the entire site, it's an important change (I'm even changing the Victor Web name, which has lasted for 5 years, to Syntactic Saccharose, to denote the importance the weblog now has) and I can't devote much time so I'm slow going.

Here you can have a sneak preview to the look & feel... mostly the same but completely new :)
