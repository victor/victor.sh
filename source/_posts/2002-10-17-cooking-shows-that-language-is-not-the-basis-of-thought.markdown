title: Cooking shows that language is not the basis of thought
---

Richard Byrne, who this week was <a href="http://www.lavanguardia.es/web/20021016/49075702.html">in Barcelona giving a conference</a>, and <a href="http://psy.st-andrews.ac.uk/research/sprg/index.shtml">his team at the University of St. Andrews</a>, dispel the myth that language is the origin of thought.

As they put it, gorillas can 'think' recipes for cooking without formulating them in words, but rather as a sequence of steps in order to prepare a meal. Other apes also express similar behaviours, says Byrne.
