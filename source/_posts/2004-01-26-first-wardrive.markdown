title: First Wardrive
---

Even tough I've had a wireless enabled laptop for close to 2 years, I had never went wardriving until this weekend. 

This Saturday, I drove on the highway between Barcelona and Girona, and then to a country house in a rural area near there, with NetStumbler scanning for  available networks. The first contact was made no more than 2 minutes after I opened the laptop! To my surprise, no less than seventy nodes were found by NetStumbler, including many set in the middle of the countryside (just in front of the labs and HQ of an animal health company).
This has got me wondering to see if I could have connected to any of those networks. I think I shall go out any weekend soon, on board a roof-less bus and scan the urban area in search of open networks, and see how far I can get from there.
