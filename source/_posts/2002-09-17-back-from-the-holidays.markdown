Well actually it was last week that I came back to Barcelona, but the return to work, to university, to email and to live in the big city has left me little time to post.

<b>Birthday</b>

Last Sunday was my birthday, I turned 27. The pals at work gave me the DVD edition of <i><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00004R72J/victorweb-21">Lord of the Dance</a></i>, while my parents gave me the DVD of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RDP8/victorweb-21">the Lord of the Rings</a>, my brother the book <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684860368/victorweb-21">Celtika</a> (about Merlin) and Mireia, my girlfriend, the DVD of <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00005RDOK/victorweb-21">Moulin Rouge</a> and a <a href="http://www.massimodutti.com/">Massimo Dutti</a> knit jacket (dark grey with a red line at the bottom).

I thought it would be more traumatic to turn 27 (I mean, just as every year has been lately) but I haven't noticed nothing. It must mean I'm maturing already...

<b>Saturday Night</b>

Saturday Night we were with our friends to have a cheese and wine party, leveraging the fact that some of our friends went to France. Mireia and I brought a couple of bottles of Croatian wine (did you know that wine bottles there have no cork?), we saw pictures of their travel (while we took some pictures, I have not finished uploading them yet) and celebrated, in our friends' peculiar style, that Mireia and I are going to live together. Great fun all the way, if I can say so.

<b>The Cat</b>

Also, we are going to adopt a cat. Her name will be <b>Pljeskavica</b>, or <b>Pljeska</b> for short. Pljeskavica is the name of a Croatian dish we enjoyed while there (similar to a onion beef hamburguer inside a pita) and that we used as the patron for prices. She is grey and small (for she is very young, for the moment). I will at last be able to fulfill the destiny of all personal sites, that is, to post pictures of my cat!!! Bwaaahaahaaa!!
