title: I switched
---

If you had read lately my blog, you'd know I was pondering the possibility of getting a hosting provider with Mac OS X. Well, I have switched <a href="http://uptime.netcraft.com/up/graph?site=www.claddaghring.org">one of my sites</a> to <a href="http://www.xrackhosting.com/">XRackHosting</a>, and I think it's proving a good idea.

As soon as they get some more requisites working, I'll probably switch Syntactic Saccharose too.

I use W2K at work, linux at home and OSX for hosting my site. I wonder in which group that lefts me in Tim O'Reilly's <a href="http://www.macdevcenter.com/pub/a/mac/2002/08/21/switch.html">Switcher Stories</a>.
