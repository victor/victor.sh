title: Coincidence?
---

I saw this <a title="Mining Technology - New Mono Coating Provides an Effective Answer to Rotor Abrasion" href="http://www.mining-technology.com/contractors/pumps/mono/press2.html">headline</a> and immediately thought that it was a .NET-on-UNIX pun... but it seems it is not.

Even the banner at the bottom seems to hint at some .NET conference...

Is this coincidence, serendipity, or what?
