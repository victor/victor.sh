title: Tech-Ed is here
---

Today's is the opening day of the European Tech-Ed. And I don't even know which sessions to attend, if any :(
Last year I was not all that interested in attending a Microsoft sponsored convention. After attending it, I decided it was not that bad. And this year I was looking forward to it, I admit it.
Unfortunately, I've been too busy the last couple of weeks to even have a look at the programme.
And, my gf is switching DSL providers so no broadband during the weekends to have a look at the site...
