title: Kinja is up (in Beta)
---

<a title="Kinja, the weblog guide" href="http://www.kinja.com/">Kinja, the weblog guide</a> is up since yesterday (I guess). What is it? Well, just an RSS reader. So what is the novelty? It presents the newsfeeds as a weblog, not as an RSS feed.
It also allows (like bloglines) to publish what you are reading, but I think (have just created my account) you can select individual items to get published, much as if you were DJing posts.
