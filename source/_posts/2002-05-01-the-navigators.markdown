title: The Navigators
---

My gf and I intended to go to see the Navigators (by Ken Loach) tonight, but unfortunately the listings were wrong, the movie is no longer playing in Barcelona.

So, we went to have some ice cream at Farggi (a chain much like Häagen-Dazs) instead. I usually ask for a vanilla ice cream ball floating in a cup of orange juice (really! try it!) but today I went for a new treat. I asked a couple of tangerine sherbet balls topped with hot chocolate. I thought the chocolate would melt the ice cream, but the chocolate formed a crust around the sherbet. Mmmmm.... delicious! kind of a frozen orange After Eight ;)

(She asked for vanilla and cookies ice cream topped with hot chocolate also. It is tasty too, but too creamy for my taste). It was a good night to go to the movies, there's a high interest football match tonight (Madrid vs Barça semi-final of the Champions League), but we were a bit disappointed for not being able to watch the movie, so we have come home instead. We'll have to see it on DVD someday....
