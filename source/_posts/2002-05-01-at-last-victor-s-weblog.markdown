title: At last, Victor's Weblog
---

That's it! At last, I moved providers, got my act together and am entering again the blog scene.

I had a previous weblog, which I began a bit more than a year ago, but I didn't update often. And, it was in Spanish so it had a reduced number of potential viewers.
This time, I am doing it with a nice tool (<a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>) and in English. Also, I have a lot of ideas on what to write about, so I hope you won't find it boring.

Well, that's all for now. Welcome to Syntactic Saccharose, and please forgive the mess while I finish putting Victor Web and SS together ;)
