title: Missed Meetings
---

Apparently, as I learned today, I missed two interesting Meetings that took place recently. One of them is the <a title="TROBADA WEBLOGGER - 30 Abril BCN" href="http://trobada.elforat.net/">Barcelona Webloggers Meetup</a>, which took place on April 30th. The other one, which was the 24th, was the <a href="http://barcelona.pm.org/index.cgi?llengua=en">Barcelona Perl Mongers</a> monthly meeting.

The next Perl Mongers meeting, btw, will probably have an honor guest: <a href="http://primates.ximian.com/~miguel/">Miguel de Icaza</a>. Let's see if I can make it (though I am already forecasting a couple of busy weeks ahead of me)
