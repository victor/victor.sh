title: New design for my company
---

I just uploaded the revamped site for <a title="Planeta Actimedia" href="http://www.planeta-actimedia.es/">my company</a> (that is, the company I work for). The old one was just too ugly, and showed its age, IMO.

For the moment the English version is not online yet, the Google translator will have to do it.

No I didn't have nothing to do with its design, I only coded the contact forms.
