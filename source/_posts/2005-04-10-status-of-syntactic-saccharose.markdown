Seems the import plugin that Patrick Lenz wrote to import data from MT3 has worked well. I've got some problems with old posts whose allow_pings value were set to null, instead of true or false (probably because they predate pings and trackback support) but after editing the database, all has been fine. Now, need to test things like comments and such.\r\nAlso, I've moved the location of the blog to www.carotena.net/weblog. Not that I like it, but seems the routing (rails routing, I mean) is easier this way. Need to think about the ultimate location that I want for it.
