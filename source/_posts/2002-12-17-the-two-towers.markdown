title: The Two Towers

A friend of mine has tickets for the pre-screening of the LOTR:TTT movie. There is a slight possibilty that there is one spare ticket for me... if so, I could be one of the first lucky people in the world to see the film before the rest. If not, well, I had scheduled to go watch it by the end of the year, which I'd do anyway.

I am longing to see Fangorn, Eowyn and Grima, which I have barely glanced in the trailers...
