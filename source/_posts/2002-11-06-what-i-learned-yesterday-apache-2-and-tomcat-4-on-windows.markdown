title: "What I learned yesterday: Apache 2 and Tomcat 4 on windows"
---

Yesterday I had to quickly prepare a JSP solution in one of our servers. The chosen platform was Apache and Tomcat on Win32. Having seen the new console of apache on 2.0.36, I went for a fully "last version" Apache 2.0.43 and Tomcat 4.1 install. Alas, how rapidly technology evolves!!

The installers went smooooothly, no problems in running as a service. If I had to be picky, I'd just say that the JK2 (the apache-tomcat connector) is underdocumented. But hey! that's what you get when you play on the bleeding edge!!

Definitely I'll upgrade the windows personality of my laptop (and probably the linux one too) to this tandem :)
