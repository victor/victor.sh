<blockquote> However, with some laptops doing 1600x1200, is this a huge win? Horizontal res is critical for developers IMO, which is why I run the two LCDs at home, but if you have 1600x1200, you have an awful lot of pixels.

Yes I do. I happen to own a Dell Inspiron 8100 with a 1600x1200 LCD screen. It's great and has become my main computer from the moment I got it. The display is so crisp! When I have to use the desktop PC, it always hurts my eyes (the monitor is unfocused already)
The xentex approach is interesting, if only it had a seamless union...

This is clearly aimed at the power user (or the developer, as Brad says). Normal users don't bother to go past 1024x768 pixels... they don't appreciate screen real state. That's why 17" flat monitors are so expensive, they settle for a cheap 15" 1024x768 display.
