title: Ulysses new life
---

It's due time I backup Ulysses and reinstall linux on it. I've been experiencing filesystem corruption on the root partition, and the <c>fsck</c>s only aggravate the situation, because the inodes end with weird permissions which prevent me from unlinking and reinstalling them.

The most noticeable effect it's the damage to the <c>/etc/network</c> directory, where the scripts and settings for bringing up the network interfaces live. Fortunately, Ulysses has a CD-RW drive and I have plenty of spare discs. The only problem is selecting what to backup and how, and verify the info is retrievable.
