title: FreeBSD basics

Nice <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/bsd/2003/01/23/FreeBSD_Basics.html">article on FreeBSD</a> at O'Reilly just in time for my retake on learning this system. The dual notebook idea is smart, I just keep one set of notes on things that do work, not on the things that don't work. Once I get the ADSL up and running I will have a great time setting up and updating my home network. Only 10 days or less left (after 8 months of waiting for it!!)

<blockquote>Once I figured out how to do something, I didn't have to reinvent the wheel when I needed to do it again six months later.</blockquote>
