title: Gaudi's Dream for New York

<img style="float: right; margin-left: 8px; margin-bottom: 8px; border: 1px solid #CC0000" src="http://web.lavanguardia.es/lavanguardia/img/20020531/gaudi310502b.jpg"/>Apparently, some New York entrepreneurs asked Gaudi to design a skyscraper for lower Manhattan. A rendered interpretation over Ground Zero, and over the current location of the Empire State Bldg. was presented yesterday in a CD-ROM at the GÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ell Palace in Barcelona.

Actually, Gaudi just made some sketches, which were developed into real blueprints by his <i>padawan</i> Matamala.
