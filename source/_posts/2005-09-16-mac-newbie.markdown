title: Mac newbie

Since I last wrote about it, I've received my new iMac G5. The thing is, I was so busy playing with it, that I didn't feel like writing. Also, I had not much to speak about, being new to OS X. I've learnt quite a lot in the last couple of weeks, and I think the best way of writing about it is by writing short snippets of interesting things to know, that may come as news to some users of OS X. And, if not, may help other newbies perhaps.
