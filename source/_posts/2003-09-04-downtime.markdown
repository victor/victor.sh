My server is currently down and has been since yesterday morning. I'm
drafting this entry offline so as to publish it when it comes back up.

So why is it down? It seems I hit some operating system limit of the memory
amount that can be shared between a process and its children. The server
stopped reacting and I couldn't even login at the console when I got back
home. After rebooting it, I proceeded with the task that I was doing that
morning when it first started misbehaving, compiling OpenSSL. I don't think
this is the culprit, but maybe it interacted badly with apache (the real
memory hog in this box) and took it down. The thing is, I left it
recompiling and this morning I didn't check out the result before leaving.
If I had, I'd have seen the machine was hung again, and would not find
myself unable to reboot it remotely. That makes it 2 days offline, and it
feels already as if I had fallen from the web :( That's one of the downsides
to be self-hosted. You cannot walk to the server if you aren't home in the
first place.
