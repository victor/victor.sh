title: Dedicated server woes
---

I have been pondering for some time the possibility of getting a dedicated server and get rid of incompetent tech support, as well as hosting some sites for which I could get a buck or two, or having a reliable IMAP service. Unfortunately, dedicated servers have traditionally been thought for demanding services, which lets the personal server category under-attended or over-engineered.

But it has come to my attention <a href="http://www.serverbeach.com/">ServerBeach</a>, a personal server hosting company for less-demanding sites as mine. I might consider switching to it, I haven't had Apache::Gallery installed yet after some months. That'd mean terminating my account with <a href="http://www.xrackhosting.com/">XRackHosting</a> for the <a href="http://www.claddaghring.org/">CRD</a> domain, since I'd need to save up for the dedicated server (and, after all, I haven't got certain features like mailing lists, Apache::Gallery or ssh access). And since I could serve any number of domains, that'd prove a good inversion after all.

I will have to think about it... the only gripe I have is that they use RH servers, and I'd prefer debian or FreeBSD. Well, maybe RH has improved since last I used it...
