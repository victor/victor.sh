title: Delicious birthday
---

Today I was browsing del.icio.us and noticed a small cake icon in the top left corner, which led to a blog entry that announced del.icio.us'  [second birthday](http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/09/terrible_twos.html) was yesterday. What a happy coincidence! Now, not only Tommy Lee Jones, Sophie Dahl and Oliver Stone will share my birthday, but del.icio.us as well!
