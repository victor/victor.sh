No amount of photoshopping will do any good to this image so I may as well post it as it is:

<a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/images/gallery/IMAG0074.html" onclick="window.open('http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/images/gallery/IMAG0074.html', 'popup', 'width=600,height=800,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/images/gallery/IMAG0074-thumb.jpg" width="200" height="266" border="0" title="me and pljeska" /></a>

She is only 3 months and already scores more than I at minesweeper! And is not that I am bad or something, she's actually very intelligent and knows how to play and how to operate the trackpad. I'm so proud!!
