title: First mention of the Ketchup Song
---

I was wondering when I was going to see the first mention of the Ketchup Song on a weblog, or if I would even see it someday. Today I visited <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/622/">Textism</a> and found such a reference :)

Since I don't know if it's known overseas (I have seen it on MTV Europe only), let me explain it's a Macarena-like summer song which has been wildly popular in Spain and other european countries. Its sung by three sisters (the <i>daughters of the Tomato</i>), and it's like a rehash of the Rapper's Delight by the Sugar Hill Gang, as <a href="http://www.textism.com/about/">Dean</a> points out.

I heard this song last summer in Italy and Croatia even, which surprised me to no end because it's not really that good, only funny (and sticky). Go figure...
