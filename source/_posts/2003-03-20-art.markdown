We went yesterday to an art exhibition opening. It was packed with people, and actually there were some nice works (some other where <acronym title="pieces of shit">POS</acronym>). Many eccentric people, some outright disgusting and some quite nice.

As I was saying, some nice works. And, while they were not way expensive, they were'nt cheap either. It made me think I should get more into art, myself. Back in my time, I was a decent painter.

Maybe I should get into digital art. For some time now, I've wanted to acquire a digital tablet. I could fill this website with senseless drawings with it. Or should I wait for the Tablet PCs to become affordable? I don't want to wait, and I have decided I want my next computer to be a mac (even if it has to be a Classic ;)

Probably, I should start by getting a decent scanner. But I'm too lazy for that.
