title: Which aggregator do you use?
---

I'm curious with respect to my readership. While my stats show a number of suscribers from bloglines and other clients, the feeds are refreshed with uneven regularity so I don't have a precise idea of how are you reading this blog. So please, leave a comment on this entry and tell me which aggregator you use. I'm also curious with respect to who you are (I know just a handful of my readers) so if you leave you URL or ping me I'll be sure to pay you a visit too.

I'm also thinking of creating an aggregator, so tell me what's the favourite feature of yours.
