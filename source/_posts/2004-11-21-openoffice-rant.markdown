title: OpenOffice rant
---

People may say all they want about MS Office, but I say this: OpenOffice is not yet ready for prime time (or else, I am too much used to the MS way, but I don't think it is so since I don't use it all that much). I've been trying to use OO all the weekend and I am stumbling with missbehaviours every couple of minutes.

Why is it that these things always fail when you have a deadline?
