title: Off the bound?
---

<a href="http://on-the-bound.net/">This site</a> appeared on my referrer log. No mention in it to my site, though. The last entry said she was moving. Where to? She didn't specify.

Now, all it shows is a goodbye note. Kinda sad, it was the first interesting referrer appearing in the log.

Was the hit a worm? an spider? an experiment? I guess I'll never know.

Not that it really bothers me, anyway...

I've been seeing the last few days and on and off discussion about blogging becoming mainstream. It is a shame that it'd all go to happen the same moment I reenter the <i>blogging scene</i>. Now, it could loose the fun factor. 

So what?

For the record, I was blogging more than a year ago (not much in the Blog timespan, yeah. And it took me time to realize that this is what I wanted to do, I had been considering it way before that but I didn't think it was the format that best suited me.) and I left it after 2 months or so (other things were always in the middle, too). But I think this time is different. First, I am doing it in English. I'd think it would'nt make much of a difference, but it seems my target audience is not that of my country. As a developer, I find myself reading developer blogs more often that not. I follow interesting --and entertaining-- discussions, and I even take part on some of them. Actually, I think this time <b>I do have</b> an audience, as opposed to before. After just a few days of beginning this new experience, I've already <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104841/2002/05/10.html#a72">been linked</a> by one of the people whose weblog I follow. Granted, I was responding to him and he would'nt have know about me if it weren't for his referrer log as well, but it goes to show that I have interesting things to say, if only to some people.

After re-reading Dave Winer's <a href="http://davenet.userland.com/2002/05/07/howToStartAWeblogforProfessionalJournalists">How to Start a Weblog</a>, I'll think I'll begin to weave <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/">Syntactic Saccharose</a> deeper in to the <b>Blog Loom</b> (or shoud I say <i>patchwork</i>?). My intention was to analyze and comment technology and biotech news while they were a novelty, or tingled my fancy, if only to show that I knew about them (that I was on the loop ;) before certain self-proclaimed gurus. Already I have received positive feedback. I think I'm on the right track, and I haven't even started to post the things that have been on the back of my mind for a few weeks now.

I feel empowered now. I feel <i>enabled</i>. I'm realizing some part of the web-culture that I didn't enjoy since the times when I first got online at the U. --back in the lynx days--. Even as a web developer, I had not enjoyed so much the feeling that I was contributing, that I was shaping the web since those good old days.

So, be prepared. I might not have anything worthy to say again, but I sure will try to tell it to you anyway. If you are not interested, don't listen. You don't have the time to read useless rants, I don't have the time to accommodate to your tastes; better search for an interesting site somewhere else ;) you deserve it, as I do. I don't care if you think I am a late bandwagon joiner. I don't care if it is mainstream now. Email is mainstream too, and that won't stop me from using it. This has allowed me to use pre-made tools instead of creating (or adapting) my own, and concentrate on the things I have to say.

Back to work now...
