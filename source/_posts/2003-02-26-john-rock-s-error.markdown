title: John Rock's Error
---

An interesting, albeit lengthy, article about <a href="http://www.gladwell.com/2000/2000_03_10_a_rock.htm">John Rock</a>, the co-inventor of the pill. My anthropologist friends (specially, the demographists) will decidedly like it. [Via <a href="http://www.megnut.com/womens_issues/002643.asp">megnut</a>]
