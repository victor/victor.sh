title: Silly search strings

Here are a few of the search strings people where using when they stumbled upon this site (when entries are similar I group them):

<ul>
<li>sushi for beginners</li>
<li>saccharose</li>
<li>download irreversible movie</li>
<li>framework of sherbet machine</li>
<li>madness of love, joan the mad queen, juana la loca movie...</li>
<li>wallpapers vanilla ice</li>
<li>could not access 'cdo.message', cdo.message access</li>
<li>hotel attraction. gaudi's project for new york, hotel attraction gaudi</li>
</ul>

Most of them are comprehensible and actually related to this site. But, I wonder who'd ever reverse a movie, and what to do with the framework of a sherbet machine... not to speak of plastering vanilla ice all over your walls!!
