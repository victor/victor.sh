title: more on the Jornada
---

Last time I left you I was sitting at the Tech-Ed floor telling you I had got hold of one of the last Jornadas...

Well, let me tell you about it. It is what we would call <i>refurbished</i>, if only it had seen any use. It just was on exhibition somewhere, and it came preloaded with interesting software: drivers for the stow-away keyboard from targus and a bunch of network cards, the microchai JVM, the .NET Compact Framework...

I have already stripped the unuseful things (games take a lot of space ;) I have loaded a blogging tool, <a href="http://www.pocketblog.com/">Pocket Blog</a>, with which I posted an experiment, but it seems there s still some work to do: I can just post the main text, the title is taken from the first words (I don't know yet whether is <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">MT</a> which takes it or Pocket Blog) but it may be useful, specially to prepare entries offline while on the road.

Well, more updates on the Jornada soon... I have found a lot of interesting things about PocketPCs lately. I may even start a parallel weblog, like the one I did about all things <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/wireless/">wireless</a>
