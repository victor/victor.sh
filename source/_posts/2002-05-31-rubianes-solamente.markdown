A group of friends went last night to see a play by a galaic-catalan comedian called <a href="http://cervantesvirtual.com/bib_autor/Rubianes/">Pepe Rubianes</a>. It is a monologue almost two hours long, but in the end it seems too short. The audience was laughing all the time, often to the point of not being able to hear some remarks of the artist.

If you understand spanish, you can hear some clips here: <a href="http://cervantesvirtual.com/bib_autor/Rubianes/voces.shtml">http://cervantesvirtual.com/bib_autor/Rubianes/voces.shtml</a>. Enjoy!!
