title: Trying to catch up
---

Due to the weeks I've spent abroad and to the preparation of a peculiar family meeting, I've barely touched my email client or any of the aggregators I use. Now I have a bit more freeish time and I'm trying to catch up with this huge backlog of news. Specially appalling is the fact that I've lost track of the rails mailing list, which was the only list I managed to really be up to date with. A couple of major revisions have been released without having time to test them. Anyway, I will try to do it even if it takes some time. Let's hope is not too much.
