I've started experimenting with a cover page for this site, based on the same Typo installation. Ideally, it will contain the latest blog entry as well as any other front page worthy items (like latest pics, latest code updates, and so on). While I haven't settled on the definitive layout yet, nor have finished migrating all the content from the old site, something is already visible. So where does it sit? why, at the <a href="http://www.carotena.net">root of the site</a>, of course!
