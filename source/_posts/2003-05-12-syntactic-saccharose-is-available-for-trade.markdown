title: Syntactic Saccharose is available for trade

The value of this blog 
<a title="BlogShares - Syntactic Saccharose" href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/">has increased</a> over the $1000 mark so now it is available for trade. I don't know exactly how it has come to happen (since incoming links don't add up to that value) but it means I will now claim it for my player.

I didn't want to claim it yet (and thus increasing automatically the value by $1000) because I was of the opinion that claiming a blog shouldn't automatically qualify it for trading, that blogs should demonstrate their worth before being allowed to be traded.

So, now that you know that it will automatically increase its valuation in the near future, be wise and invest on it... ;)

<b>Update:</b> Whoa! As a side effect, <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http://www.bookstash.org/devblog">other</a> <a href="http://www.blogshares.com/blogs.php?blog=http://victor.carotena.net/wireless/">blogs</a> have also increased their valuation, which in turn will increase mine in a feedback effect. I need liquidity!!
