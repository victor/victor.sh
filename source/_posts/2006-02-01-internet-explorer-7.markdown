title: Internet Explorer 7
---

As I was explaining elsewhere, Internet Explorer 7 is out there. No noticeable changes, my own Typo theme still shows overlapping sidebars over the content.

So, I'll stick with the Lucid theme (edit: not that it looks correctly in ie7)

Someone please wake me up when this browser finally respects standards (like Firefox, Opera, and Safari already do).

No download link, of course. Why would you want to do that???

I'm curious, though, to see how much it will take for ie7 to start registering noticeably in my visitor stats.
