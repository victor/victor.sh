title: 1/5th of me

This morning I tried a curious artifact at Mireia's lab, which measures the index of body fat by having a low-intensity current run through your arms and measuring the resistance.

It turns out 20% of me is fat tissue! I could fill more than 3 5l. bottles of fat by squeezing it out of me. Mireia says a lot of fat is actually in the brain, I wonder how that affects people on a diet...

Gotta work harder at the gym...
