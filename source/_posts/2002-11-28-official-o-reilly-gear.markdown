title: Official O'Reilly Gear

I <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/000121.html#000121">announced a few days ago</a> the new MegaTokyo store at Thinkgeek.

Now, the ThinkGeek bunch have announced the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/oreilly/">O'Reilly Store</a>, featuring t-shirts with the O'Reilly animals. As if I didn't spend enough money on shirts and books, I can now get a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/oreilly/tshirts/5bbe/">Classic Perl Shirt</a> or a cool <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/interests/oreilly/tshirts/5bcf/">OS X shirt</a>.


What I don't get is why they keep calling camel to a dromedarian...
