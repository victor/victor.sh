Tonight is the premier of the long-expected movie adaptation of the [Alatriste](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=ur2&tag=victorweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&path=external-search%3Fsearch-type=ss%26index=books%26keyword=alatriste) novels, created by Arturo PÃ©rez-Reverte. The plot is set in XVIIth Century's Madrid, when the Spanish empire was beginning its decline. With Viggo Mortensen as Captain Alatriste and lots of other first-line Spanish actors and actresses in the cast, I can't wait to see it (but I will, at least until tomorrow ;)
