Mireia and me went to Zaragoza this Sunday to spend the Christmas Eve with my family. We've come back this morning to be with her family for the Christmas meal. That's why I've been unresponsive to email these days. Unfortunately, the MySQL server crashed the night of the Sunday so the website couldn't accept comments nor trackbacks :(
I'll respond in the following hours to the mail, specially the backlog of emails regarding <a href="http://slunj.carotena.net/projects/mtplugins/mticon.php">MTIcon</a>.
We celebrated a little house party the night before (maybe it had something to do with the crash?) and it seems we got a small intoxication, with delayed effects. Fortunately, it only lasted for a day (as a Spanish saying goes, bad weed never dies...) and we are completely recovered by now.
