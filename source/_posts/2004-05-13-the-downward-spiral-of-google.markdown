title: The downward spiral of Google
---

While I admire the conditions set upon the Google IPO, I'm noticing some lack of care regarding Google AdSense. A few days ago, they reevaluated a lot of applications and accepted into the AdSense program some sites which wouldn't have passed the strict criteria before.

Now, Google is killing what differentiated them from the rest: they aren't anymore a text only ad network. They now do run <a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/faq#imageads">ImageAds</a>.

This is somewhat unsettling, I've worrying already.
