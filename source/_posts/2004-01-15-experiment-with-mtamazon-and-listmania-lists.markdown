title: Experiment with MTAmazon and ListMania lists
---

I've made a small modification (as I do all the time) to the site. I have modified the index template to use the <a href="http://mtamazon.sourceforge.net/">MTAmazon</a> plugin to display the "Currently Reading" list,  (instead of doing it by hand). 

The way I do it is by creating an Amazon <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/listmania/list-browse/-/33PEADY4D6OFT/ref=cm_aya_av.lm_more/002-4978359-3306423">ListMania list</a> and populating it with my book list. I the use its ID to search it and publish it in the home page.

Yeah I know it's not that original, but it has occured to me that I could use that while <a href="http://dev.bookstash.org/">BookStash</a> is not ready.

If you'd like to use the same method to publish your list, allow for 5 or 6 days for the list to be available via Amazon Web Services, if you create a new one.
