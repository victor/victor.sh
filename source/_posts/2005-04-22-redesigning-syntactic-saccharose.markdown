title: Redesigning Syntactic Saccharose
---

Now that typo is correctly installed and somewhat stable, I'd need to deviate a little from the standard look and feel that all typo blogs share. I haven't even looked at the code for that but it seems to me that I'd be designing new standard issue rails templates for that. I'd also like to add things like commenters favicons and things like that. Need to ask in the mailing list whether there is some support for optional plugins or I just modify directly the source. (mmhh.. let me try a trackback, to call Tobias' attention to that ;)
