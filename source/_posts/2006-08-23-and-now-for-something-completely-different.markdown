title: ...and now, for something completely different
---

Well, since Typo kept being a resource hog, and with all the pain that this move induces, I've taken the decision to try mephisto. Let's see if with it, I'll be able to keep the site running... 
I've begun by moving all my posts from Typo (had to put some dummy IPs for the older articles for that to work). The static pages, the themes with mint cookies and all that will soon follow.

Meanwhile, please be patient if you see some glitches. Looks like sometimes the db queries consume all the available memory :(
