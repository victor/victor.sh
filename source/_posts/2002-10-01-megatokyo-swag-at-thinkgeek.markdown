title: Megatokyo Swag at ThinkGeek
---

I just realized there is a <a href="http://www.megatokyo.com/">Megatokyo</a> section at the <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek store</a>, where you can buy all sort of MT stuff (ok, T-shirts) from the geeks that know. I wonder how long it's been open, I haven't checked the sites in a long time, and the last TG newsletter didn't have any mention of it, that I remember.

Ouch! just now that I have to procure after my savings!
