title: 1st Anniversary

May 1st marked the first year of existence of Syntactic Saccharose. Being a late-comer in the blogosphere, I can say I am already satisfied with the results of this first year. A few regular readers in a already saturated market, are good results for me. Even if I had no readers, for I do this for myself, mainly.
I want to celebrate it by finishing some due redesign, which I have already begun to test. I will need some facilities in the server to fully realize what I am envisioning, though...

I was not at home to write about it, however. We were taking a small trip to Zaragoza, to visit my family. It was a shame not to bring the camera, because the wheather was accompanying and some sightings stunning (imagine an &#230;olic park from within).

I am however late to the blogshares game :( I have not been able to buy the interesting stock now that its price was reset, it's still like in the beta, when I entered the game late.
