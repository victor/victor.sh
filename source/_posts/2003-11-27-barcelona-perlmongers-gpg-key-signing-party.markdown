title: Barcelona PerlMongers GPG Key Signing Party
---

Like every fourth Thursday, the Barcelona Perl Mongers meet to share insights and discuss elevated topics around Perl.
Today there is such a meeting, and since we had no one volunteering to give a presentation, we'll discuss the remodelation of <a href="http://barcelona.pm.org">Barcelona.pm</a>'s web site and, partially because of my proposal, have a <a href="http://barcelona.pm.org/gpg-party.html">GPG Key Signing party</a>.

I created my key pair some time ago, but since it was not very useful (since no one I knew used encryption) and had to be on my linux workstation to use it (and using mutt) I stopped using it after a bit of experimenting.

Today, with the advent of <a href="http://enigmail.mozdev.org/">Enigmail</a>, I can use it at my own leisure in an easy to use, unobtrusive GUI way.

So, if you want to send me private mail, you can use my public key to encrypt your message. You can find my public key at many keyservers, or right here:

My key ID: <code>0x6DF1354D</code>
Key fingerprint: <code>762F 2DF9 8DFE 2323 8341 399F ECDA 8664 6DF1 354D</code>
