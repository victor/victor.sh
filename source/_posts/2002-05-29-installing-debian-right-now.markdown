title: Installing debian right now
---

In this precise moment, my debian laptop is getting the base woody packages (and the saved selections from the previous installation) from the local mirrors.

I have used <a href="http://people.debian.org/~blade/XFS-Install/">blade's XFS install disks</a>, I think reformatting the partitions with a completely new filesystem will get rid of the corruption problems. The <c>/home</c> partition is still ext3, I will not delete it. The other partitions either will be reinstalled from scratch, or will have selected files copied from the backup.

Still at 4%... ~645 packages to go :P
I think I'm going to bed now, I will let ulysses downloading the packages...
