title: The Mac is back
---

I picked up today the iMac from the repair shop. In the end, it turned out to be a faulty logic board. They replaced it up and I'm using it right now to write this post.

Since the machine was broken since before the MacWorld Keynote (where Steve Jobs announced, among other things, some updates to the operating system itself) I was eager to try them out. I'm already running 10.4.4, but I also want to try the new features^W bugfixes in iPhoto 6, and looks like this will cost me around â‚¬68. Mmmhh... looks a bit too much for the possibility of making calendars.
