title: Holidays!!
---

Well, today is my last day of work before holidays.
I will be visiting the Czech Republic during the first fortnight of August and then visiting some family out of Barcelona, so don't expect many updates to this blog or to other projects. The next revision of MTMakeTitle, for example, will have to wait until late August (I have many ideas to implement so it will take a little more, thankfully I have already witnessed open source at work and have received contributions)

So, if some reader of this blog is going to be in Prague, Ãƒâ€žÃ…â€™eskÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â½ Krumlov or Zaragoza; don't hesitate to write a quick email and we can have some beers and discuss highly elevated topics.

The pictures will be posted when I come back (I don't think we'll be able to upload them from the road, unless we encounter some open Wi-Fi hotspot)
