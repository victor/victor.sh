This post has been a long way coming. At first, becasue every time I set to write it, during the very first days after his untimely death, I could not bring myself to do it. I was surprised by how deeply it affected me. Afterwards, when I could clarify my feelings about it all, I just happened to be my hands already full preparing my presentations at the NSCoders Conference. My inner Steve Jobs was telling me that the conference was more important tant my blog, and I had to do a good job.
