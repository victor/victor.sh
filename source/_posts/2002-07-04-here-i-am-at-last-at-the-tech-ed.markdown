title: Here I am, at last at the Tech-Ed

Finally I made it today to the Tech-Ed. I'm writing this from the wireless zone, it seems now works better than this morning.

I also got one of the last Jornadas! They where sold out yesterday, but it seems a little shipment came overnight to respond to the demand. No wireless option for the moment, though

And now, let's attend a session by Bertrand Meyer...
