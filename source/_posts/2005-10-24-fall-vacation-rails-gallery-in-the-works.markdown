title: Fall vacation. Rails gallery in the works
---

In the end we didn't go to the Netherlands. We are saving up for a nicer travel next year. I took a week of vacation, though. Which I've used to study and to hone my ruby skills. I have had the opportunity of programming a couple of rails sites for extended, contiguous periods and this has really been a opportunity to gain agility with it.

After plowing my way through the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=ws%26link_code=xm2%26camp=2025%26creative=165953%26path=http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html%253fASIN=097669400X%2526tag=ws%2526lcode=xm2%2526cID=2025%2526ccmID=165953%2526location=/o/ASIN/097669400X%25253FSubscriptionId=02ZH6J1W0649DTNS6002">rails book</a>, I have realized how I can bring to fruition my rails-based picture gallery (which is in itself an adaptation of the excellent perl-based [Apache::Gallery](http://apachegallery.dk).

I will begin work on it this very week. Meanwhile, is there any talented reader that would draw some icons for it? Preferably someone with a couple of OSX iconsets under her belt.
