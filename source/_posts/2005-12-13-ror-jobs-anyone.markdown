title: Ror jobs anyone?
---

Every day that passes, I am more in love with this not-so-new web technology, [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.com). I definitely want to use RoR professionally in the near future. Yes, that would probably mean switching jobs... but I think it's worth it. I'm hooked on productiveness.

So I am not *actively* seeking, but I'm hereby open for offers from any company that wants to employ a medium to advanced Rails developer. Location doesn't matter, as long as it is Barcelona or I can telecommute of course ;)

If interested, please contact me at the previsible email address at this domain to discuss the details.
