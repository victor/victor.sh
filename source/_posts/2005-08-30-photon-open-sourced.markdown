title: Photon, open sourced
---

Thanks to [Douglas Bowman](http://www.stopdesign.com/log/2005/08/28/photon-open-sourced.html),  I've learnt that [Photon's source](http://www.daikini.com/photon/) [is now LGPL](http://www.daikini.com/archives/photon/2005/08/25/01/). It will prove useful in my quest to learn Objective-C and Cocoa. And, who knows, in time, I might even be able to contribute to it.
