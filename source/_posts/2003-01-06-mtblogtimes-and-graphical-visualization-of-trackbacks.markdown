title: MTBlogTimes and graphical visualization of trackbacks
---

It seems <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/000155.html">I spoke too early</a> (when saying it occured to me first) or too late, actually.
I mean that, when I wrote that, I had thought about it for a long time, and probably before <a href="http://nilesh.org/weblog/2002/11/30/svg_blogtimes.nc">Nilesh wrote about it</a>. But then again, he probably thought about it before he blogged it.

In any case, seems the <a href="http://www.lazyweb.org/">LazyWeb</a> is at work again, because, if not already doing it, someone's at least <a href="http://nilesh.org/weblog/2003/01/06/the_timeline_of_life.nc">working on it</a>. Anyway, since I'm somewhat advanced on it, I'll try to finish it. My idea has been not to make it a MT plugin or template, but a service (or WebService if you like buzzwords) for all the blogdom to use, that given a RSS URI will plot the timeline for that blog. I'm thinking it could be applied to a blogroll to, since individual blog entries rarely overlap, but a <i>blogrollful</i> of them could surely, and, now that we are on it, we could draw lines representing trackbacks. 

Umm... a graphical representation of trackbacks... now, that's another good idea for the lazyweb!!
