title: Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow...
---

In Barcelona, snowing at sea level is a fairly rare event. However, I live now in a town near Barcelona which is about a hundred meters above sea level, and when I woke up this morning, I found that it had snowed during the night and that a layer of just 1cm. of snow covered the windowsill and the nearby woods.

Even then is a rare event, so I took a picture to freeze the moment (pun intended ;). The field is very reduced, as I used the zoom to peek through the blinds.
