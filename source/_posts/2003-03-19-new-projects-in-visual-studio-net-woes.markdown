title: New Projects in Visual Studio.NET woes
---

Is there a tutorial out there, that will show me how to create new Projects and Solutions in VS.NET, the way their Creators intended it to be done?

It drives me out of my mind to have such a nice IDE as VS.NET and then finding out the piece that breaks all the otherwise smoothly integrated environment: the SourceSafe integration.

Everytime I create a new Solution or Project, I have to fight my way through this process. I don't grok it. How come I can't decide where I want my project files to be placed? Will I have to switch to NAnt just to place the files the way I intend? (believe me, I would do it, is just that I'm not allowed to)

I believe there has to be a proper way to do this, just that I don't know about it yet. That's why I'm asking for advice.
