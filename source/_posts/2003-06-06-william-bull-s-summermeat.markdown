title: William Bull's Summermeat
---

A long time after the disappearance of Artillion (now a nasty site) I have found again a site by William Bull (of BeOS and QNX fame), <a title="Coming Soon: The Summermeat Inn" href="http://www.summermeat.net/">The Summermeat Inn</a>.

If you don't know of William's work, he's an expert UI developer (among other things) which has designed Neutrino's interface. Since the Artillion site is no longer (and, if you read this, William, I really miss it) you can see some samples of his impressive work at <a href="http://www.summermeat.net/topics/samples/">http://www.summermeat.net/topics/samples/</a>
