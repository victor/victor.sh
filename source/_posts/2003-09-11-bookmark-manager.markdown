title: Bookmark manager

Today I installed <a href="http://www.n-gon.com/freshmeat/b./index.html">b.</a>, a bookmark manager implemented in perl. It allows you to store your bookmarks on the server side, and a handy bookmarklet allows me to bookmark the pages I am in.

Interesting so far. Maybe now I'll consolidate the different bookmark collections I have lying everywhere...
