title: About Susan Kare and pixel fonts
---

Recently, I was reading <a href="http://www.kevinandapril.com/april/">WebtasticLand</a>'s <a href="http://www.kevinandapril.com/cgi-local/april/web_link.pl?link=colophon">Colophon</a> and being the Macintosh fan that I am, I couldn't help but follow the link to the <a href="http://www.wpdfd.com/MiniFonts.htm#sm">minifonts</a> (which I will probably buy, btw). The all-new <a href="http://www.minifonts.com/">minifonts</a> site tells interesting things about pixel fonts.

When I was at High School, I designed my own 5x5 font on 1mm grid paper and began toying with the idea of a 5x7 font (I had just an <a href="http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=111">Amstrad CPC</a> at that time)

The thing is, I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.kare.com/">Susan Kare</a>'s work. And, hours later, I went to Zeldman's and was given <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0602b.html#weekoff">more of the same</a>.

So, I cannot help but admire UI pioneer Susan Kare's work.

And is with a great consciousness about pixel fonts that I approached the Jornada. I will look into replacing the default system font with a pixel font, so as to have more presentational density.

BTW, looking at my site with the Pocket Explorer I realize it is due for a redesign. I was going to do it anyway, but now I have something to test it with. Scaled images look ugly on the Jornada display, now I have a excuse for using pixel fonts...
