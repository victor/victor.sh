title: Gnome 2
---

I have installed <a href="http://www.hadess.net/articles.php3">hadess</a>'s packaged Gnome 2 debs in the desktop machine (which runs unstable)

It is quite spiffy. However, it also has some wrinkles to iron out. It allows me to choose default TT fonts but does not seem to use them, for example.
It reminds me more of MacOS or BeOS than windows, this time. I will have to install the BeOS fonts and play a little with some BeOS themes, and let's see what happens then...
