title: PITA with Debian Sarge
---

I just upgraded my trusty laptop to Debian Sarge. All has gone well, except for the fact that
my <code>XF86Config-4</code> file has been rewritten by dexconf and in repairing it, I have
somehow lost the ability to use AA fonts. You know, that classy font-smoothing that Linux recently got.

And man, is this a real <acronym title="pain in the ass">PITA</acronym> or what?
