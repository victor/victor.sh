title: Happy birthday to me!
---

Today I am 28. Feels more or less like 27 if I remember it correctly ;)
Happy birthday too to Oliver Stone, Tommy Lee Jones, Sphie Dahl, Agatha Christie and Carmen Maura!

I've taken the day off of work, and I've decided it's a thing I want to do every year and that I recommend to everyone.
