title: Fried {Rice,Bacon,Tomato}
---

<h5>Components (for one ration):</h5>
<ul><li>A garlic clove</li><li>A small cup of rice</li><li>100gr. of bacon, cut in little bits (at Spanish foodstores, they sell it already cut)</li><li>A couple of small tomatos.</li></ul>

<h5>Integration:</h5>
<ol><li>Boil the rice in salted water. Do it half-way, stop it before it is cooked completely.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, put olive oil to heat in a pan, with the garlic clove cut in two or three pieces</li>
<li>When the garlic is getting brown, add the tomatoes cut in half, and some of the bacon.</li>
<li>Turn the tomatos upside down when they are done at the bottom. Once they are fully done, remove them of the pan and put them apart in a dish. Salt them.</li>
<li>Add the rest of the bacon and let it fry.</li>
<li>Add the rice, add some salt and let it fry until crispy. Serve with the tomatoes and a speckful of herbs (I like <acronym title="Oregano marjorana">oregano</acronym> and <acronym title="Ocimum basilicum">basil</acronym>).</li>
</ol>
