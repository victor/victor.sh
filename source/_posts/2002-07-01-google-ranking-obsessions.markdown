title: Google Ranking Obsessions

<blockquote>My obsession with my Google ranking grows daily. I'm now the 13th listed "Ben". I mean, sure I've been the top Hammersley for ages, but that's not exactly hard. The top Ben, however, is Ben's guide to US Government for Kids, followed by Ben and Jerry's IceCream. They will be overcome. I shall be victorious. Oh yes. [<a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/archives/000973.html#000973">Ben Hammersley</a>]

Well, I'm #3 <i>Saccharose</i>. I can only aspire to less glorious milestones...
