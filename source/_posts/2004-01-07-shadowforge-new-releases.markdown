Last <a title="ShadowForge - Conventions" href="http://www.shadowforge.com.au/news.html">ShadowForge </a> newsletter explains the releases for this month. Some of the minis can be seen on their website: 

<ul><li>six Tribal Spear Warriors and the long awaited Nun Gridiron Team Coach, Trainer and Medical Officer.</li>
<li>a second Tribal command group, Tribal Berserks and three more Toons.</li>
<li>February should see the last release of the current Tribal infantry and the first re-release of the Dark Temple Guard range which we (ShadowForge, that is) are revising and extending at the moment.</li>
</ul>
