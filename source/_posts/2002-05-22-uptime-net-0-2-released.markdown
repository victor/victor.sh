title: Uptime.NET 0.2 released
---

I just sent <a href="http://lists.baselabs.org/archives/csam-authors/0047.html">the announcement</a> to the CSAM-authors list. <a href="http://mono.baselabs.org/index.php/CSAM/modules/System/Diagnostics/Uptime/releases/0_2-1.bml">Uptime-0.2-1</a> is out, and it works for Windows and Linux.

As soon as I update the <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/devel.jsp">project page</a>, I'll submit it to freshmeat.
