title: Wireless Pre-N
---

I just received at the office a shipment with Belkin Pre-N gear: a router and a couple of laptop cards, with which I hope to improve the bad reception I have been getting lately from my years-old 802.11b setup at home.

I don't care, for the moment, that it is propietary as long as the router can interoperate with the pc-cards and with 802.11g equipment, like the iMac that should arrive later this week.

I'm dying to get home to try it!
