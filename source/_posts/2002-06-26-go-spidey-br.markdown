title: "Go Spidey!/*********"
---

Spider-man dindn't premiere in Spain until last Friday. I went to see it with some friends on Sunday. All of us enjoyed it a lot, and thought it was a very good adaptation of the comic (even better than X-Men). The vertigo sensation when Spidey is learning to swing is awesome (I suppose the fact that we were on the 5th row also contributed ;)

The special effects were... unnoticeable. I mean, they were good enough not to be noticed as such. The CGI is nowhere to be seen, specially near the end (at first you notice some unrealistic movements when Pete goes jumping over Queen's rooftops)

All in all, a very enjoyable movie. I'll definately buy the DVD.

This movie's rating is 9 stars
