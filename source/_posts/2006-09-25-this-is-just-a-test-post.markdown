Lately, rails has been playing tricks on me. The applications would go and disappear under my feet, segfaulting sometimes without even logging a message. That's why I'm posting this, to see if the problem appears now that the TXD folks are having an eye on it.

* Update: * Umm... somehow, it's good news that no problems occur... but then, if there really is a problem, it won't help that it doesn't appear now... 

It's a bit annoying somehow. I migrated to mephisto because I suspected typo's bloat would have something to do with the problems, and now I am missing some features that mephisto doesn't yet implement (I don't doubt it will, mephisto is very young still). And yet, I won't go back, since I'm interested in hosting multiple sites with a single instance of whichever rails app will do that, and just now, only mephisto does it. If it stays stable for one more day, I'll deem the issue –closed– vanished and try this feature (yes, I haven't really tried it yet)
