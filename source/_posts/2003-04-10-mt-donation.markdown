title: MT Donation
---

I finally did what I was meaning to do for a long time: open a paypal account and make a donation to <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Ben and Mena</a>. Now I am impatiently waiting for my Recently Updated key ;)

I also wanted to learn how to use paypal to receive donations, a friend of mine is having some success with a website of his and wants me to coordinate the donation process. We hope to at least cover the hosting fees.

<b>Update (11/4):</b> I have it!
