title: Intermittent Gold Box
---

It must be the weather. Like Cory Doctorow, I sometimes get the box and <a href="http://boingboing.net/2002_08_01_archive.html#85306642">sometimes not</a>. I thought I had lost it either because they have discontinued it, or because I had not bought anything (why of course, the offers are always dumb but it's interesting to discover what uncanny offer you may get next).

Right now, for example, the Gold Box is present. But last week was not. Is there any reason for this behaviour?
