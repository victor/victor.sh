According to <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/06/16.html#a2017">John Robb</a>, Dave Winer is in the hospital and will be until newt weekend at the very least.

I miss his posts already. Davenet is like some radio-beacon that keeps us all oriented. Everywhere I go, I see posts talking about it. Let's wish him a quick recovery...
