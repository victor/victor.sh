title: Picking back a hobby
---

Many years ago, I used to play RPGs and wargames. I liked to paint miniatures, even if they weren't intended for actual play. Unfortunately, I had to let this hobby slip in favor of other occupations.

I promised myself that one day, I'd pick up the pencils again. And, a few weeks ago, I decided it would happen this month, so I'm inaugurating a new category, 'eavy Metal (with apologies to GW) to post my progress and keep me motivated. 

Since I also have to study, this hobby will probably have to take place on the weekends though.

As I have discovered recently, there have been many companies that are now gone. This is a shame. However, there are new companies to take their place. For example, the makers of the Celtos wargame (a game which, curiously, I discovered a year ago in Zagreb)
