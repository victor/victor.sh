I'm about to finish ['the Broker'](http://www.randomhouse.com/catalog/display.pperl?isbn=9780385510455&view=oonline), from John Grisham, which I picked up at the Chicago airport newstand, to help me pass the many hours of flight that I had before me.

Now, I've been bitten by the spy-novel bug and would like to pick on John Clancy's series on Jack Ryan. I have seen the FAQ online describing the list of novels that compose the so-called [Ryanverse](http://www.clancyfaq.com/ryanverse.htm). Now, my question is, should I read them in its published order or in its storyline order? What's best?

And, while we are at it, any other spy-novel book you would recommend? I'm interested in non US-centric agencies, if such a thing exists (perhaps something by Ian Fleming?)
