title: Dancing with the Dubliners
---

Some members of the <a href="http://www.claddaghring.org/" title="the Claddagh Ring Dancers">CRD</a> went yesterday to a concert the Dubliners were offering at the Auditorium in Sant Cugat (a nearby town). As it happened, JosÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Luis, one of them, had sent them the day before a quick email telling them of us, what we do and that it'd be nice to meet them and gulp some pints of beer, and even nicer to get to dance there.

You can imagine the rest of the story can't you? ;) Halfway through the gig, John Sheahan announced a couple of reels and a jig, and said that if anyone felt like dancing, to feel free and do it. He said that they had received an email about the Claddagh Ring Dancers, and asked us to step out and dance.

Well, what else could we do? Shyness is for cowards, so up we went and danced a four-hand reel (unfortunately, this had the side effect of not allowing all of us to dance, since only four people are needed, but we were to excited to realize it at the moment :( ). Before a cheering audience, we performed the dance with the Dubliners, an experience that we would never have expected to come just minutes before!

Afterwards, we chatted with them and got some autographs. Very nice and down-to-earth people...

Of course, as soon as the pictures are developed I'll post them here.
