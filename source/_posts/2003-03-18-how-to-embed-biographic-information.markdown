title: How to embed biographic information
---

When I read David Galbraith's proposal, I was wondering how to actually embed the info at the document level. This <a title="Adding Biographical Information to RSS at Internet Alchemy" href="http://internetalchemy.org/2003/03/addingBiographicalInformationToRSS.html">proposal</a> intends to clarify and exemplify this. When I have time this weekend, I'll weave in my info.
