title: IIS Migration Wizard
---

A few days ago, one of our load-balanced webservers experienced disk problems on one of the RAID arrays. All seemed ok until we tried to reboot it, which it was unable to, because the array was corrupted somehow.

The end result is that we had to reinstall the server from scratch. This <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/techinfo/reskit/tools/existing/iis_migration_wizard-o.asp">nifty utility</a> is coming in handy.

<b>Update:</b> Don't bother, it's totally useless.
