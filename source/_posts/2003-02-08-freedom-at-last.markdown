title: Freedom at last!!!
---

Today I asked for the nth time since June about my <acronym title="Asymetric Digital Subscriber Line">ADSL</acronym> connection, and they told me that the last update was that yesterday, the connection was ordered for (when in truth, I asked for it last week) and that it should be ready in 10 to 15 days (yeah sure!)

Just to try it out, I dialed the number which gives you the configuration settings based on your dialer id. And surprise, it gave me the settings. Since I already have the DSL router (from my parent's house) I configured it with this settings and... voilÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  ! I'm online! and now I'm surfing from the dining room table, thanks to the wireless home network :)

I'm free at last!! <code>apt-get update</code> time!

(now let's see why OÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Â¾u is meowing like this...)
