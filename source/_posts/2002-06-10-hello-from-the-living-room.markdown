title: Hello from the living room ;)))

Yes! I finally did it!

I pulled the umbillical wire that kept me connected to the ADSL router. I've gone wireless!! This entry is posted wirelessly, as you suspected ;)

It has taken me some time to figure out how to connect to the router, which actually is in bridge mode, from the access point. But now, my girlfriend and I will be able to roam the house with our laptops. Maybe even her brother, who lives next door, will be able to hook to the network through the wall and surf the net too.

Now, I only have to figure out how to make it run under linux... fortunately the card is supported.
