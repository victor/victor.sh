title: Onions Youghourt
---

The <a href="http://www.spainalive.com/spain/foodanddrink/articulos/articulo3/index.jsp?nombre=calcots.html">calçots</a> are a typical catalan food, which basically are charred spring onions. The season begins around this time, and to celebrate it, some folks will present a dish they have perversely devised: <a href="http://www.lamalla.net/canal/noticies/localia/article.asp?id=122452">calçots-flavored youghourt</a>. Eeewww!!! 

Just the fact of thinking on it gives me the willies.

What I thought, of course, that had to share with all my readers.
