title: I'm back (in Google)!!

Finally! for some time now (and I think, it's probably related to the intermitent availability of the site) Victor Web was nowhere to be found in Google. I just checked now, and the site is on the listing again.

It is curious that the site is not the first hit when asking for my full name. My last name is not common, even in Catalunya. The first hits are related to me, of course, but due to Google's PageRanks, the list archives of the CSAM project are rated first.
