title: Snapshot of Victor Web
---

While my new provider investigates further where should I upload my jar files, I have put up a static version of Victor Web, to allow me to at least let people find and download my open source tools.

I have pointed <code>wget</code> to my own development machine and recursively downloaded a snapshot of the site. 

So, when you are ready... <a href="http://victor.carotena.net">proceed to Victor Web</a>. And make yourself at home.
