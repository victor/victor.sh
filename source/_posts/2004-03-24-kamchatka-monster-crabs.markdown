title: Kamchatka monster crabs

It seems like the storyline of a comic book.
<a title="Stalin's last army - hordes of gigantic crabs on their way to invade Europe" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/02/28/wcrab28.xml">Stalin's last army - hordes of gigantic crabs on their way to invade Europe</a>. Lots of giant-sized crabs are marching south through the Norway coast, while the norwegian govenrment is undecided whether to treat them as a pest or as a resource.

Too bad I can no longer eat crustacians :(
