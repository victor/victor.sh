title: I did it

Finally this morning, I got my act together and joined a gym. I've been planning to do this for years. The last routine check showed I have unusual levels of cholesterol, so I finally got up a pair of shoes and a pair of shorts and signed up.

I intended to start this very morning, before going to work. Unfortunately, the sign-up process was so time consuming I had to leave by the time I was ready. If I'm able to wake up early tomorrow, I'll begin then. If not, wednesday. I'm very tired now, and I think tomorrow morning will be still.

I don't think I'll note as much detail as Marmalade and friends on their <a href="http://www.marmalade.maermaid.com/gymblog/">gym.blog</a>, but some notes from time to time won't be too much, don't you think?
