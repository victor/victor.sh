title: The (european) Linux for PS2 fiasco
---

I received yesterday, just before ending my work day, a message from Sony Europe announcing the availability of the Linux kit for the Playstation 2 (which seems pretty interesting).

The dumbasses had modified the reply-to header of the announcement, which has resulted in a slew of messages asking further questions, a lot of angry people asking to be unsubscribed, and a lof of bad feelings directed towards the company.

One would think that the people who manage to port Linux to the PS2 would know better than that. That's what you get when you leave marketing people in control....
