title: Novell acquires Ximian
---

I just fired SharpReader to get up to date on the news that happened while away, and I find out that <a href="http://www.ximian.com./about_us/press_center/press_releases/index.html?pr=novell">Ximian is acquired by Novell</a>!

I didn't expect this turn of events. I just hope this doesn't signal an end for Mono.

Oh! and, on related news, mod_mono now runs on Apache 1.3 too and as a shared process. Let's hope this means it works right on FreeBSD too (right now it segfaults on me)
