I have just downloaded [Inbox](http://www.midnightbeep.com/?p=79) during the lunch time and launched it, and then hibernated the machine, so I don't yet have an opinion. But looks very nice!!

More comments when I test it...

**Update:** Yeah well... I can say it's going to be very nice working with Inbox. The beta, though, still doesn't do automatic processing of items, but looks very promising. I have decided I'll pony up for it, without waiting to the [MacZot](http://maczot.com) or anything.
