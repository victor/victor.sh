<small>(This is a long due review. Excuse me if I've been busy.)</small>

This past wednesday we went to have dinner at <a href="http://www.kittyosheas.com/barcelona.html">Kitty O'Sheas</a>.

I had goat cheese and warmed apple salade, while Mireia had Brie with honey and walnuts. Both of these dishes were delicious. I'd have had smoked salmon (I love salmon!) but I'd it for lunch, so I prefered to try something different.

The main courses, however, were not up to par. I had pork loin with mustard sauce, but the meat was tough and the knives wouldn't cut it, and had to be chewed hard. She had lassagna, and it wasn't bad, but compared with the salad it was just regular.

The dessert, home made apple pie for both, was somewhat dry. Fortunately, the waiter was kind and nice. All in all, and uneven experience.
