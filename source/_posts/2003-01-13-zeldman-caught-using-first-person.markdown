title: Zeldman caught using first person
---

Jeffrey Zeldman may be too stressed writing his book, because he has failed using his characteristic plural style. In the <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/0103a.shtml#thisreporter">Daily Report</a> for the 8th, Zeldman was caught in the act of speaking about <i>me</i>:

<blockquote>I used to get snotty mails from Omniweb users when their browser failed to properly handle web standards on one of my sites.
</blockquote>
