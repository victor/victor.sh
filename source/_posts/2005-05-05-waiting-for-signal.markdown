Yesterday at work, we had SDSL (Symmetric DSL) installed and we were expected to begin testing it today. However, some issues with the physical layer are preventing us from having connectivity yet. SDSL is supposed to allow for greater upstream bandwidth, which comes in handy for the VPN tunnels to our head office in the UK and our customers. 

Anyway, I expect that connectivity will be restored soon, even if it takes the legacy ADSL line, to post this entry. I'm eager to test the technology, is relatively new in Spain.
