title: Retaking Bookstash
---

I'd like to announce that the Project Formerly Known As Bookstash has been retaken with a new impulse thanks to the wonder that is <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>. I've been able to have a fully working, incomplete propotype just spending some lunch times over the course of a couple of weeks. It really is that productive.

I need to stop development for a couple of weeks though, having exams and all that.  I will try to think a good name meanwhile --bookstash is owned by James Buckley of <a href="http://www.ordinary-life.net/">Ordinary Life</a> fame, and he prefers to reserve this name for his own purposes, which I am cool with. I have a couple of ideas already but since the corresponding domains are already taken, I'll try to think harder.

So, what's this whatever-its-name app? Well, if you use <a href="http://www.singlefile.com/">Singlefile</a>, you'll certainly know that they're closing at the end of this month. Also, Delicious Library seems cool, but since it only works on OSX, lots of people are left without it. For example, I haven't used it and don't even know if it is possible to sync your collections over the network between 2 or more machines. Since my thing-a-majig will be web based, you'll be able to use it wherever you happen to have a net connection available.

But enough for now. If you are interested in it and would like to help test it, just ping this entry or drop me an email -- I have recently disabled comments.
