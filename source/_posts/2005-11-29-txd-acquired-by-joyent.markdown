title: TXD acquired by Joyent
---

I'm still trying to come to grips with the [acquisition of TextDrive by Joyent](http://weblog.textdrive.com/article/186/textdrive--joyent--w00t). I'm pretty sure Dean Allen and Jason Hoffman wouldn't have sold if everything wasn't nice and dandy, but I'm still afraid that I will miss the friendly style with which they were running the company and that Joyent (of which I know nothing about, except that they sell a nice application and that [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net) works for them) will somehow spoil it all.

I would have said, just last week, that Joyent was indeed a Web 2.0 start-up, with a nice product but without the resources needed to pull it, specially when they are distributing hardware; but looks like it has deep pockets. Had I fantasized last week about a merger, it would have been the other way around, with TXD taking the lead; or at least, with parity.

Well, I suppose only time will tell. As long as TextDrive is TextDrive, and don't meddle with my hosting, I will be happy about it. I'm looking forward, though, to Joyent's much fanfared webmail app, which TXD customers will get to enjoy.

**Full disclosure:** I am a TXD VC-II customer and this site is, indeed, hosted at Tex^H^H^HJoyent
