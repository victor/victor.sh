Right now, the current projects include bringing a couple of sites back to life - like this one, now powered by Mephisto, or [Planeta Rails](http://www.planetarails.es/); an aggregator for the Spanish speaking rails community.

Lately, I have been interested in giving [microformats](http://microformats.org/) a spin, so I have launched [SpotSpotting](http://spotspotting.com/), a site where TV commercials are reviewed (as if they were movies), and am preparing another site for reviewing and recommending restaurants worldwide.

I hava also started a new section, [Choclit](/choclit), in which I try to learn Objective-C and Cocoa in public, sprinkiling in some Ruby and C# so as to make it more palatable.
