title: Quitting my job
---

I've been sitting on this announcement for some days now, but I guess it's time to let the cat out of the bag.
After almost 4 years of working for <a href="http://www.planeta.es/">Planeta</a>, I am to quit in a few days. Beginning next month, I'll work for <a href="http://www.pivetal.com/">Pivetal Limited</a> (or, more precisely, Pivetal Sistemas, the Spanish branch) developing network management software. The company applies AI and process control technologies to the telco industry. Quite a big change from what I'm doing now!

This means I won't be doing big scale web development for a long while, at least for a living, that is. It hasn't been easy to take the plunge, but I guess the web development world is too crowded for me ;) Seriously, I'm always eager to learn new things, and opportunities of this kind only present themselves <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/000222.php">once a year</a>.
I'll be sure to follow the trends in internet development (so as to leverage the investment in time I've already made) and probably will have the opportunity to apply internally those skills, though it's still early to say. The company's site certainly needs a revamp, but hey! who am I now to say so? ;)

More news on the subject once I've spent a few days on the job.
