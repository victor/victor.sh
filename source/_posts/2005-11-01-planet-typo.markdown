title: Planet Typo
---

Someone went and actually implemented my suggestion of a [Planet site for typo](http://www.planettypo.com/). It looks like it's the same people who are donating a couple of Apple laptops for the [Typo theme contest](http://typogarden.com/). I would have liked to do it myself, but hey! you guessed it: I don't have the time. Besides, my design skills are not up to par, the template is really cool.

Now I can have a single feed for all my typo needs, which was really the point. I have submitted my site as a possible contributor (filtered [by tag](/articles/tag/typo)), I have not posted much about typo yet, but I intend to do it, especially when my patches are ready to be contributed (for the moment, I want to test them a bit more)
