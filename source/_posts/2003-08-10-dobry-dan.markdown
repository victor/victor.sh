Just a quick note from a cyber cafe in Prague to explain that we are well, that we are enjoying our stay and that I don't have much time because we are supposed to be consulting roadmaps and bank accounts ;)

It's a shame I cannot upload yet the pictures, and that my camera doesn't work that well for night pictures. Prague by night is an awesome and undescriptable view, so we'll have to wait for the analogic pics to be developed.
