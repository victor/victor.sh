title: Starbucks coffeeshops in Barcelona
---

I was walking with my gf by the center of Barcelona last Friday when we noticed and interesting and <i>fashionable</i> cafeteria. Upon looking at the front door itself, to learn about that new place's (formerly a grocery) name, I was surprised: the once-familiar green letters of the <a href="http://www.starbucks.com/">Starbucks</a> coffee company, together with the green & white mermaid logo. I didn't know they were stablishing a presence in Spain, the company apparently has 2 more shops in Madrid. Actually, the store in Barcelona must be brand new, because it doesn't even appear on the website.
There was a lot of people inside, mostly foreigners by their appearance. The store itself doesn't have the same look&feel that the stores I saw in Seattle, but this makes sense because they tend to adapt each store to the idiosyncrasy (is this an English word?) of the places they inhabit.

We didn't go inside, though. We were going to have an ice cream and that's what we ultimately did. I'll try to visit the store one of these days, to check if they have wireless connectivity, though I don't think so. But I have to try it anyway, maybe the coffee isn't as bad there as in the american stores.
