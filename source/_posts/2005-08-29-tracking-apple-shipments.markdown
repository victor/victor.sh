title: Tracking Apple shipments
---

As the loyal readers will remember, I'm waiting for an iMac I ordered recently. I've already received notification of its shipment, but the Apple Store status page doesn't go any further and doesn't tell how to track the shipment.
Fortunately, I've found an [Appletrack webapp](http://www.apecode.com/appletrack/) that allows me to follow the shipment until it's transferred to TNT for local delivery.

They go so far as to give you the source code to do it locally. Once it's delivered to TNT, you can track it normally using TNT's system.
