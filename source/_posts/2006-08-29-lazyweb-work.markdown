Via the [Mephisto](http://mephistoblog.com) site, I've found that one of the projects that I have in the freezer (namely, the [client-based syntax highlighter](http://www.carotena.net/2005/6/10/recent-projects)) already has a [working implementation](http://projects.danwebb.net/wiki/CodeHighlighter) by [Dan Webb](http://www.danwebb.net/). I don't know how well it works yet, I'll have to try it. I'm curious as to its support for nested languages and complex expressions (judging from the language definition files, it is only based on regexen, so I don't know if Dan will have added support for that)

In any case, it's in a more advanced state than mine and working on Safari, too! Cheers Dan!
