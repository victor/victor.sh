title: "The Two Towers: Sneak Preview"
---

I just have seen the second installment of the LOTR saga. I have been lucky enough to assist to a sneak preview of the movie, thanks to a friend who got invitations from the sponsor of the premiere in Spain.

I don't want to spoil the fun, so I'll just post a few impressions. The movie seems long, there's a lot of things to be told. It reminds me at times a Star Wars movie: Oliphants as ATTs, Osgiliath as a ruined version of Naboo, Gollum as a kind of Yoda. Ents are the Gungans, and the fall of Gandalf and the Balrog seem an XWing battle in the core of the Death Star.

You will like the beginning of the movie, with Frodo dreaming with Gandalf and the Balrog ;) 

Well, more details tomorrow...
