title: How I wish this were true
---

A rumor spotted on <a href="http://www.thinksecret.com/news/0412expo2.html">Think Secret</a> hints at a sub-$500 Mac. How I wish this were true! Ever since OSX appeared, I promised myself that my next computer acquisition would be from Apple. (I've partially fulfilled it with the U2-iPod Mireia got for Xmas ;) And no, the USR OpenAP doesn't count as a computer)
I have a good LCD panel with DVI prepared for it. Too bad Apple discontinued the cubes :(

Unfortunately, if this rumor gets spread, <a href="http://www.daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> will dismantle it with lots of sound technical and market reasons (as he always does). But one can dream, can't I? Too bad today is Dec. 28, i.e., the equivalent of April's fools in Spain :(
