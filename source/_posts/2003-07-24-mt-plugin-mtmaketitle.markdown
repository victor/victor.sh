title: "MT Plugin: MTMakeTitle"

I have written a nifty plugin for dynamically rendering antialiased headers using <acronym title="TrueType">TT</acronym> fonts.

I just need to package it and it'll be ready for posting at <a href="http://mt-plugins.org/">mt-plugins.org</a>.

BTW, does anyone know which is the exact path on OS X for the TT fonts? I could just ask Google, but I prefer to invoke the power of the <a href="http://lazyweb.org/">lazyweb</a>.
