<a href="http://www.ordinary-life.net/blog/archives/001545.php">A comment on his library</a> by <a href="http://www.ordinary-life.net/">James Buckley</a> spurred a quick cascade of emails wich led to the creation of a new project, <a href="http://www.bookstash.org/">BookStash</a>.

You can learn all about the development of the project on the devel blog at <a href="http://dev.bookstash.org/">dev.bookstash.org</a>.

I will keep you posted about all the milestones and interesting insights here.
