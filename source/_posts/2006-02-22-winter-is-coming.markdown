The thing is, we're attending the 75th annual meeting of the [American Association of Physical Anthropology](http://www.physanth.org/annmeet/). Or rather, Mireia is. I'm curious about some of the papers, being a frustrated biologist myself, but it's Mireia who's presenting a communication. I think I'll like the views better.

In any case, both of us will enjoy the wilderness at the edge of the world. And Seattle as well, which I visited once in 2000 (although that occasion I spent most of the time in Redmond... yes, because of that corporation that springs to mind). I will be glad to show Mireia around (as if I knew the city that well!): Pike Place Market, the Space Needle, the original Starbucks, the Pioneer Building, Belltown, ...and then there's the Mt. Rainier National Park (which I guess will be closed at this time of the year). Of course, if there's anything more you recommend, whether in Seattle or Anchorage, feel free to comment here :)

And then, there's the return trip, which will be via Chicago. Since we'll be arriving early in the morning and leaving during the afternoon, perhaps we'll do a quick dash and try to see a few landmarks as well!

Oh! and, for those of you who didn't get the pun, please do yourself a favour and check [A Game of Thrones](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&path=ASIN/0553573403&tag=victorweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325)
