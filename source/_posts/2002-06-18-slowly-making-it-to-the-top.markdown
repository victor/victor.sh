title: Slowly making it to the top

Funny. Brad <a href="http://www.quality.nu/dotnetguy/2002/06/17.aspx#a200">liked</a> my <a href="http://www.quality.nu/dotnetguy/comments.aspx?cmd=view&msg=194">comment about  Wil's RSS feed</a>.

Not much of a discovery, though. Being a <a href="http://movabletype.org">MT</a> user myself I already had an idea of where to look for it (ok, I admit it took me 2 tries...)

Let's hope if next time I get mentioned I can get a link to Syntactic Saccharose. It would help greatly my GoogleRank ;OP . Heck, I'm almost owning the term <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=saccharose&ie=UTF8&oe=UTF8&hl=es&lr=lang_en%7Clang_es">Saccharose</a>!
