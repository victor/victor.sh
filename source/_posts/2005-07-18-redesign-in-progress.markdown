title: Redesign in progress
---

I've become so tired of the Kubrick theme! Unfortunately, I don't get much time to try new designs so... I am doing a live redesign, over on the main page, and testing ideas as I go. I want to go to a more pixel-art-ish look, with light greys and sparse bright colors. Edit-CSS is proving once again a fantastic plugin. What I am definitely going for is an extra wide post column: I want to post code, and code tends to go wide. And I don't like to scroll when reading code, it gets in the way. So, no fancy slim columns for me!
