title: The Biggest Threat To Peace

The Biggest Threat To Peace: a <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/gdml/peace2003.html">poll by TIMEeurope.com</a>. I think it hits the nail down.

I don't usually blog about politics, but this time I think its deserved. So much arrogance on the part of the USA leaders and so blatant abuse of public media by the Spanish goverment well deserve it.

Tomorrow we'll be going to the rally held in Barcelona, where more than 1 million is expected to attend. Since the official press will discount the success (they usually post images of the mob once it's dismissed) I'll bring my camera to take pictures on the ground (I received just now a mail that asks for complicity in a simulated bombing after the demonstration, allegedly from the avant-gard group <i>La Fura dels Baus</i>, which you may know from the Barcelona Olympics' opening ceremony).

As an example of blatant manipulation, the public TV broadcasted a<span style="text-decoration: stroke;">n infomercial</span> documentary about Bioterrorism. I think the programming of such piece of trash was so blatant that it spoiled the frightening intent. The actual bioterrorists are the ones who allowed the Prestige catastrophe to happen.
