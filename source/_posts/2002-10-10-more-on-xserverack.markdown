title: More on XServeRack
---

It seems XServeRack is about to launch. Today I visited their site to see how many days left (thay have consistently announced 4 or 5 days for the last 4 or 5 days :) and was greeted by this page:

<a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/images/gallery/XServeRack.html" onclick="window.open('http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/images/gallery/XServeRack.html', 'popup', 'width=1280,height=1024,scrollbars=no,resizable=no,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=no,left=0,top=0'); return false"><img src="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/images/gallery/XServeRack-thumb.png" width="200" height="160" border="0" /></a>

(I copy it here in case it is updated later) At first I thought on the iTools site, where through the magic of some Mac-only app you could publish to a site directly, but then I realized this is the kind of page that appears as a default in some personal serving apps (like Apache), so it seems they probably have the Mac OS X Personal Web Sharing app on on the server. I hope they use instead a fine-tuned Apache, for I am interested in hosting with them (yes, lately I've wondered a lot about hosting on OS X as a way to avoid some problems with some hosting services)

BTW, I am also thinking on buying a second hand Power Mac to run Mac OS X and some other apps. There are a few nice offers on <a href="http://www.ibazar.es/">iBazar</a> (the Spanish version of eBay).
I could even acquire some old PowePC just to run BeOS on it and really learn C++ ;)
