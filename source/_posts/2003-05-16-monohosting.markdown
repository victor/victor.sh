I've been looking for hosting alternatives recently for internetfutbolmanager.com, as you may know. While doing so, starting my own reselling/hosting company occured to me, naturally.

Yesterday, I also had the idea of specializing on hosting ASP.NET on Mono (since you need something to attract prospective customers in this overcrowded market) and I was thinking on asking Miguel what would he think about when I'd send him the pictures.

Of course, I have asked Google about mono hosting and <a title="monoHosting.net :: hosting mono the ASPX .NET alternative"  href="http://www.monohosting.net/">such company</a> already exists! I will take a look at their packages, maybe that's what I've been looking for after all :)

I would have taken a lot of time to start such a project anyway! Glad someone already has thought of it. And, I think I won't be deceived by support: installing the ASPX hosting engine is not for the faint of heart! ;)
