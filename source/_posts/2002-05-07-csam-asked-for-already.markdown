<q>And it will be a long while before anything like the mighty <A href="http://www.cpan.org/">CPAN</A> is available for .NET. [<A href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104841/2002/05/06.html#a68">John Sands' Radio Weblog</A>]</q> Umm.... well.... we are quietly working on <a href="http://mono.baselabs.org/CSAM/">CSAM</a>.
