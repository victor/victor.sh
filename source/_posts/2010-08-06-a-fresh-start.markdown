title: A fresh start
---

Effective immediately, this blog is changing name and domain. From now on, the blog formerly known as Syntactic Saccharose will be known as **./victor.sh** and the domain will cease to be carotena.net, being available at http://victor.sh/ instead.

I will let the old domain expire, as I'm not interested in it anymore, and will set up redirections so that people looking for the old web pages, or sending mail to my old addresses can find me meanwhile. This will cost me in google rank, but I don't care particularly since the low posting frequency had made it already low anyway. At least I won't be getting spam for a while... I hope.

I think this new name more accurately reflects my identity and personality, and while it clearly marks me as a geek (as I can't pass for a Saint Helena citizen), it also brings the opportunity of starting a fresh stage.
