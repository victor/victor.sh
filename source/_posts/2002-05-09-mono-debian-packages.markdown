title: Mono debian packages
---

I'm apt-getting as I write the mono packages for debian, from <a href="http://www.atoker.com/mono/">Alp Toker's site</a>.

If today snapshots work correctly I'll be able to port my uptime tool to Linux tonight. I had interesting comments on the <a href="http://lists.baselabs.org/archives/csam-authors/">CSAM Authors List</a>, I'll probably refactor the code along the way.
