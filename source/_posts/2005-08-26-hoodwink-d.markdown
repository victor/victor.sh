I'm dying to know how to [hoodwink](http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/hoodwinkDDayThreeClearnessOfVision.html) my site. Not that the site bans normal comments, but having high profile readers on _onslaught_ is appealling.

I'm happy that I got to grab my preferred username as well :)

Don't know [what the hell](http://del.icio.us/tag/hoodwink.d) I'm talking about?
