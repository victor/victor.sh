title: Missing Orc
---

Dammit! I just realized my Orc Team lacks a player. I mean, there was only 10 figures on the box. It didn't occur to me to count the figures, but now that I was spray-painting the rest I've seen that there's one missing orc figure. And not a puny lineman, no, it had to be one Black Orc blocker! Of the two Black Orcs that compose the box, there's only one :( Waaaaaagh!!!

What am I supposed to do now? How can I remediate this problem?

<strong>Update 15/9:</strong> I went to the shop and they told me to come back today with the receipt and the box, and to ask for the manager. I went today and they will ask for a replacement box and give me the missing Orc out of it. Since they are relatively  newcomers, I didn't knew them, but I think they are nice and customer-oriented, and definitely will visit them again to complete my Warhammer army (which has yet to be started)
