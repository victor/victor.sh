An interesting description Meg Hourihan <a href="http://www.megnut.com/cooking/002529.asp">makes</a> about her new column on <a href="http://www.tekka.net/">Tekka</a>. Recently, I saw a recipe expressed as a lab experiment (ingredients were reactives, and the steps were the protocol).

After reading some of <a href="http://www.textism.com/">Dean</a>'s recipes, I also feel like posting from time to time dishes I do. I like simple dishes, especially when I have to prepare them in a hurry before leaving to work (I usually carry my lunch in a <a href="http://www.tupperware.com/">tupper</a> container) as well as ellaborated, tasty meals which allow me to showcase my cooking abilities.

So I will create a new category and post there the occasional Food Hacks, and even illustrate them with the actual result. Indicentally, I took a picture this morning while preparing today's FoodHack, <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/weblog/archives/000181.html#000181">Fried {Rice, Bacon, Tomato}</a>.

(but since the camera is still at home, I can't post the picture until this night)
