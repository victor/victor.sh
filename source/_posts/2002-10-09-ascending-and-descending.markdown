title: Ascending and Descending

I can't help but reflect on the <a href="http://www.daypop.com/top/">Daypop</a>'s top: <a href="http://www.lipsons.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/escher/ascending.html">Escher's "Ascending and Descending" in LEGO</a>

It's extraordinary! Two of my favorite topics, combined into one form of art!
