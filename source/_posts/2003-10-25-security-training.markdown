This week I'll be attending a security course. Mainly focused on Win32-based machines, but still.

The great thing is, the course will be paid off by my company, for it is not precisely cheap, and I'll have to attend during working hours.

I hope it is a serious instructor though. Too many <i>aficionados</i> organize this kind of course without having the proper skills under their belt. I'll be happy if I get to learn how to put <acronym title="Intrusion Detection Systems">IDS</acronym> to max effect.
