title: He he heeeeeeee
---

I arrived yesterday to Southampton to spend a few days with the local support & deployment team, and our new Spanish hires, to get them up to speed with our products.
We are staying in a flat the company has near the office. <a href="http://tachasUK.blogspot.com">Rafa</a>, who has spent here some weeks already, introduced us to a TV series that was aired some years ago, <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcthree/tv/littlebritain/characters.shtml">Little Britain</a>. It's so funny we all couldn't stop laughing even after stopping the dvd, and even this morning you can hear from time to time "he he heeeee!!"
I hope this night we can watch some more episodes, we were a bit tired yesterday and only watched the first two.
