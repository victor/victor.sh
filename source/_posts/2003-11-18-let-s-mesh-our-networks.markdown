title: Let's mesh our networks

I joined today the Tribe.net Social Networks site. As you may already know, the usefulness of a network increases with the number of nodes and the number of links between the nodes, so, if you are a regular (or even casual) reader of this blog, I hereby invite you to join <a href="http://tribe.net/">Tribe.net</a> and join my network.
