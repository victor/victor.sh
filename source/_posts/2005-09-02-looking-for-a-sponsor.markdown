title: Looking for a sponsor
---

O'Reilly is celebrating their first [European Open Source Convention](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/) in Amsterdam this October. By chance, I had already planned for some holidays in the Netherlands around those dates, so I decided I might drop by.

Unfortunately, the prices for admission are a bit steep for an individual - I suppose they are to be paid for by employer companies.

So, I'm looking for an sponsor, because I'd really like to attend. If you have decision power at a company, institution of foundation and none of your employees is interested or available, I can go there if you sponsor me. In exchange, I can wear a t-shirt with your logo or something like that. Also, I plan on releasing some open source software in the near future, which may or may not be of interest to your company's activities but is supposed to make people life easier -or at least, a bit funnier.

Yes, I know I have no reputation so you don't know whether to trust me or not. And I might end up not releasing anything worthy (or nothing at all). I can't guarantee anything because I don't know how much time I can devote to that. But, at the very least, you'd have the blogging exposure and the good-vibes from the community.

I don't know if I could pool individual people contributions, I doubt that there would be enough people. Of course, if you're a philanthropist or money-spoilt billionaire, you could do it just for kicks ;)
In any case, if nothing else, if you're an individual and you want to help, you can blog about it on your own site.

What kind of technologies I'm interested in? well, mostly the most popular ones: .Net and Mono, Eclipse, Perl, Ruby and Python -and Rails!-, wifi, OSX with Rendez-vous and Cocoa, SVG... yes, mostly everything. I'm a kind of an all terrain vehicle.

I think I'll just CC: the [Lazy Web](http://www.lazyweb.org/) just in case. I might get some free exposure even.
