I have recently written a new sidebar module for typo, Starred, that allows you to highlight the best articles you've written. Often, your best articles fall from the front page to be replaced by fresher content, and then, the only way to finding them is either skimming through the archives or finding them with google. So, you either need to know about them or be actively looking for them somehow.

This module allows you to star, as I said, your best content so that it is easily accesible. You cold conceivably put static links to do this function, but why do it manually when a computer can do it for you? You just put a star to the article and voil√†, it appears linked from the front page! Easy as Gmail :)

The thing is, I wanted to implement this in another blog for which I have a bit more deeply detailed articles, though I also enabled this feature here to serve as an example. When I went to select articles here to star, I dismayedly found that most of the content in this blog is not highlightable!

This needs to change. I need to write more useful or in-depth articles. No need to stop  posting anecdotes but something more solid needs to go in as well.

I am already preparing such a tutorial (just look at the upcoming sidebar), let's hope I can finish it soon
