title: Drafts sidebar for typo
---

I have uploaded a [new patch for typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/ticket/530) that allows the user to place in his/her sidebar a list of the articles that are in the process of being written, the idea being, of course, to tease the visitors with upcoming featured articles.

I would have posted about this about an hour ago if it weren't for the fact that the server was down and being rebooted by the [TXD](http://www.textdrive.com/) staff

Here's hoping Scott or Tobi accept it. I will definately use it, will install it tomorrow if I get the chance
