title: Back to the gym
---

Now the exams are over, is time to pick up again the habit of going to the gym regularly. Instead of doing a workout routine after so many weeks without doing it, I've decided to take it easy and today I did a session of stretchings.

Just to be methodical, I weighted myself anyway after the session, and actually I've lost weight since the last session (back in November). I weight 68.300Kg, (that's quite good actually) but I intend to loose some more weight (just enough to dispel the beer-belly). Let's see how things work out ;)
