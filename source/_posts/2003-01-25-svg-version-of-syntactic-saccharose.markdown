title: SVG version of Syntactic Saccharose
---

An SVG version of Syntactic Saccharose will be soon doable thanks to the <a href="http://www.protocol7.com/archives/000890.html">Adobe SVG Viewer 4</a>, because it will allow flowing text. I hope other current <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/struct.html#DOMInterfaces">missing methods</a> are fixed, too (not that I have tried them with Corel's viewer, either).
