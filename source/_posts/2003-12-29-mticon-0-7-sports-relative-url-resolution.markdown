title: MTIcon 0.7 sports relative URL resolution
---

<a href="http://victor.carotena.net/projects/mtplugins/mticon.php">MTIcon</a> 0.7 is out, and it now supports resolution of relative URLs (so if your users have just <code>/favicon.ico</code> in their tags, their icons will show). Download it at <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/projects/downloads/mticon-0.7.tar.gz">http://victor.carotena.net/projects/downloads/mticon-0.7.tar.gz</a>
