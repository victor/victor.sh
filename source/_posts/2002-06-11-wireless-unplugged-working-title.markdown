title: Wireless & Unplugged [working title]
---

I have started a <a href="http://victor.carotena.net/wireless/">new weblog</a>. It's about wireless networking, and is in Spanish. Hopefully, it will grow to become a reference blog for the spanish-speaking community

in the meantime, I'll try to participate actively in <a href="http://www.barcelonawireless.net/">Barcelona Wireless initiative</a>
