title: Sushi for Beginners

This is the title of a novel I'll begin reading tonight. I will read the first few pages until sleep overcomes me. Yes, yes, I realize I should be programming the next .NET killer app, but... life is short. So sue me ;)

As the book cover says, it's a novel about a few women publishing a magazine in Dublin. Quite a few favorite topics of mine...

Yes, yes, more weblogging tomorrow... I will write about programming services in the .NET framework, today I successfully wrote and installed such a service, but I need to do some more experiments with them, ok?
