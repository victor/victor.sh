Looking at those freakish <a href="http://www.mini-itx.com/#story0182">Frankensteined Commodores</a>, I've gone into the <a href="http://www.machine-room.org/computers/71/general.html">Machine Room</a> (an archive of old hardware descriptions) section which describes the rare C-65.

I was leaving when my eye caught a glimpse of a banner in the left side. After returning, I realized that dear to my heart <a title="The Machine Room :: Mattel Electronics :: Aquarius :: Quick view" href="http://www.machine-room.org/computers/313/">Aquarius</a> was the Computer of the Week!

Tears almost flooded my eyes :,-) sniff!
