This afternoon we will be returning to Barcelona. I'm looking forward to it, Southampton is a nice place but being away from home and Mireia (and the cats ;) is stressful after a while. Last night I went to TESCO to buy things we don't get over there (there being Barcelona) like some pieces of good cheddar cheese, pickle, sweeties, curiously flavored crisps and SPAM. Oh dammit! I forgot to buy the SPAM!!
