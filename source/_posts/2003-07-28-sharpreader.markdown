Let me join the masses that are acclaiming this RSS agregator. I used to employ <a href="http://bitworking.org/Aggie.html">Aggie</a> for a rss reader, I liked the fact that it would not poll each source repeatedly but wait until I told it to refresh the feeds.

When doing the blogroll that is now on the right side column of the main page, (which is powered by a somewhat modified MTBlogRoll plugin) I decided I'd leverage the nestability of the OPML format. Unfortunately, Aggie would not parse an OPML file with nested items --and I didn't feel like modifying the source, because I'd have to research the various implementations of <code>TreeListView</code>s available on the net-- so I ended up with out-of-sync files. This, coupled with a burst of busy-ness, has made me forgot to read my subscriptions for some time.

Today I downloaded and tried <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/">SharpReader</a> and... ta-da!! It likes my nested subscription list! And has a nice to use UI concept (which is enhanceable still) that I like.
So, I've a lot of catching up to do! I haven't even finished categorizing the items in the blogroll, but I will at some time. Meanwhile rest assured they are all good recommendations ;)

<b>Update:</b> It seems SharpReader's export format has broken the blogroll generation (which doesn't surprise me as it was modified to parse Aggie's format). No time to fix it now, will have to wait until tomorrow.

<b>Update:</b> Fixed. But I notice there's a new version of the blogroll plugin out. I should revise it and see what's new that I don't yet have, and incorporate the changes. Or, better yet, take a lesson from <a href="http://www.bradchoate.com/">Brad</a> and sent my modifications to the author.
