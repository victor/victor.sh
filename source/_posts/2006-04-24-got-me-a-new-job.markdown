title: Got me a new job
---

Earlier this year, I realized I missed developing for the web. I haven't stopped doing my late-night rails hacking sessions, but is not the same when you do it for a living and you have justification to do it all the time.

So, it is with great pleasure that I can announce that today, I've started working as a software architect for [Polymita Technologies](http://www.polymita.com), my new employer, where I will be able to work on web based projects (architecting, most likely ;) again. They do BPM (Business Process Mgmt.) and similar kinds of development. Mostly Javaâ„¢ based, for now, since that is what most middleware prefers. There will be time enough to show them rails in the future ;)

So, what is a *polymita*, I hear you asking? Well, it turns out it is a species of snail (or should I say *gasteropod*?) I would point you to the corresponding Wikipedia article, but no one has bothered to write one yet. And I am not the resident biologist, so I am not qualified to do it. Googling for that term, however, is left as an exercise for the reader.
