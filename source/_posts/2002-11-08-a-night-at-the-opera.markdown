title: A Night at the Opera
---

This night we are going to see <i>Madama Butterfly</i>. We have never been at the opera, and both of us are a bit nervous about that :P

The <a href="http://www.lavanguardia.es/web/20021027/59773653.html">reviews</a> have been positive so far. For the benefit of unacquainted readers, let me point to the <a href="http://www.metopera.org/synopses/madama.html">synopsis</a> at <a href="http://www.metopera.org/">Metopera</a>. I think it's interesting to have an opera taking place in a 20th-century setting. I guess this will mean a gentler introduction (not that we haven't seen or listened to recordings, but it's not the same)

We'll post later how it went :)
